Yeah. So I got a bit of information from what you\\'ve talked to my colleagues about. But yeah, I just thought I\\'d start by asking you what you\\'re kind of wanting to get out of coming in and working together and what your main concerns are at the moment. ### Assistant: I\\'m not 100% sure what the session\\'s about. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s about what I was talking with earlier, or? ### Human: Because she asked you lots of different questions, didn\\'t she? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. Yeah. So it can really be whatever. We can talk about whatever you want. I got a little bit of background that there\\'s been a transition in the family recently, and that\\'s been causing all the stress for you. And then you were probably talking to me about different perceptions and stuff. Is that what you were referring to? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. I mean, it\\'s really up to you. What do you feel like you would like to focus on? There might be other things that I just didn\\'t mention. Yeah. Yeah. It\\'s a collaborative process. And we work together but, yeah, really driven by you about what you think is important. ### Assistant: It\\'s a bit hard. I don\\'t know. maybe for something else. ### Human: Yep. I hope I didn\\'t put too much pressure on to say it\\'s all open. ### Assistant: No. It\\'s all right. I honestly don\\'t know what to start off with. ### Human: Okay. Maybe I\\'ll just ask. How have things been going? Because I think you probably came in a few weeks ago to see me initially, right? ### Assistant: Oh, I think the first session, we-- the first session I had here was with you. And then the other ones were with me. ### Human: Yeah. Yeah. So it\\'s probably been a little while since you first initially came in. So I\\'ve heard from you a bit, from what\\'s been going on. So maybe you could fill me in about how the last few weeks have been or how you\\'ve been going. ### Assistant: The last few weeks have been well, probably better than most weeks. It\\'s a bit muddled up with switching back between mom and dad\\'s house, so different bus stops and lots of stuff, bringing things to dad\\'s, bringing things from dad\\'s to mom, sort of making sure you\\'ve got everything, chargers, that sort of thing. And it hasn\\'t been that bad. It hasn\\'t been that busy. Normally, it\\'s a lot busier than that. We\\'ve started out football training. ### Human: Oh, cool. Is that with school or club? ### Assistant: For our local club, yeah. ### Human: Oh, cool. ### Assistant: That started yesterday. ### Human: Yep. How did you find that? ### Assistant: It was good. It\\'s starting to get a lot busier now. We\\'re getting into football season and back into school. We\\'re starting to get into school sports. We\\'re starting to get into projects at school, that sort of thing. So I think just starting to-- yeah, just getting into-- ### Human: It\\'s a new year, kind of. ### Assistant: Yeah, getting into doing that sort of stuff like football training and going to school and all that sort of stuff. So it\\'s taking me a while because I\\'ve been in holiday mode for a long time. ### Human: Yeah, yeah. It\\'s hard to start up again, isn\\'t it, after the holidays? ### Assistant: Yeah. Because you\\'ve got nothing over that period of time. And then coming back to school, you\\'re like, \"Ah.\" ### Human: Yeah.  You have to get up a lot earlier, probably. ### Assistant: Yeah, I do. ### Human: Do you like to sleep in over the holidays? ### Assistant: Yeah. It was really good. Especially the fact that the early waking up and late coming home-- ### Human: Because you have footies after school or homework or-- ### Assistant: Footies after school on a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. ### Human: That\\'s pretty full-on. ### Assistant: Yeah. And I\\'ve got school hockey on Wednesday as well. ### Human: You play hockey. ### Assistant: Yeah, for the school. ### Human: Cool. Yeah. Awesome. ### Assistant: And I play three-- well, I do three sessions of sport each week at school. ### Human: Really? Does your--? ### Assistant: I have three days with sport on it, so. ### Human: Your school, do they have a special focus on sport, or do you just happen to know? ### Assistant: They are into sport a lot. Eating healthy and being active, that sort of thing, they\\'re really focused on that. And they have courses there where you can focus on sport and the different aspects of it. But school sport, everyone tries out for. So you\\'d pick a sport that you think you\\'ll be interested in, and then you do it. So I did hockey last year, which is interesting. ### Human: Yeah. Had you ever played before then, or? ### Assistant: Mom plays hockey, and I sort of hit around a bit, not a lot. I knew how to hit, that sort of thing, but not a lot about the game. And I sort of just picked it up along the way. ### Human: Oh, cool. So you\\'re a bit of a natural at sport, it sounds like. ### Assistant: I do a lot of sport, especially during winter. Winter is when we really do get a lot of sport. Because in winter, there\\'s a lot more winter sports at school. And with football, I have football, which is just up at the school. And we train all through the year except during club football. ### Human: Is the club linked with one of the AFL clubs? Is that right? ### Assistant: Yep. You play then, and you go into the TAC cup for them, and then you get drafted from there to a team. ### Human: Oh, wow. ### Assistant: And you go from the TAC cup. And hopefully, if you get far enough, you go to the AFL. ### Human: Is that what you want to do? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah, cool. ### Assistant: I\\'m really working hard. It\\'s been a dream for ages and ages. I think playing football, I started when I was in prep, starting probably about-- I think I was five. When we were born, we had-- we didn\\'t get to pick a team or anything. Mom and dad were both football supporters. So we were sort of destined to be football supporters. ### Human: Yeah. From birth? ### Assistant: Yeah. We had footballs. We had beanies. We had jumpers, all that sort of stuff. So football has been around for ages. We\\'ve always been into football. We did oskie up until we were nine. And then we started doing club football at the age of nine and have done it ever since. ### Human: Yeah, cool. ### Assistant: So yeah, it\\'s pretty good. ### Human: It sounds like, yeah, you\\'re doing pretty well at it to be doing the right stuff. ### Assistant: Yeah. It\\'s taken a lot of practice-- taken a lot of practice with kicking. Kicking was all right. It wasn\\'t very good. But yeah, it\\'s taken a while, but I\\'ve gotten there. ### Human: So-- ### Assistant: And ever since, I think, around 13, that\\'s when we first heard about football. And that\\'s what most of the people in our age group sort of strive to go to. So you try your hardest, and they have people that come out and watch games. ### Human: Like scouts, kind of? ### Assistant: Yeah. And we have people at the club. Also, we\\'ve got a guy in the club that watches. He\\'s part of the team. And he used to coach a few times, and he\\'s always around the football club. ### Human: So he knows the players well for maybe being part of the club. ### Assistant: Yeah. He\\'s always watching. He\\'s there the first game till the end of the game. And he\\'s there all the time. He coached a few times. I think he coached three or four years. And then I think he\\'s sort of gotten more into the game, so. Yeah. But he\\'s been a part of that. And he sort of recommends to look at a certain group or certain people. So the scouts come out, then, and watch, so. Yeah. When it\\'s getting closer to winter break, we\\'re getting into football. So otherwise, we do ### Human: Yep. The preseason\\'s starting now. Because it would be, what, April or something, you\\'d probably start playing games, just a guess, or? ### Assistant: I\\'m not 100% sure. But we only started club football yesterday, and we started playing in-- I think it was the 31st of January. ### Human: Oh, right. So you\\'ve already been going a bit for that. Yeah. ### Assistant: I\\'ve had a few sessions with them, which have been good. Especially coming back from-- yeah. Especially coming back from the summer holidays, you\\'re not doing a lot. You\\'re not doing a lot of exercises. You sort of get into the swing of things eventually. And I think the first three weeks of school, I was overloaded with doing sport at school, doing sports, doing school sports, now to do club football. I\\'m sort of overcrowded by sport at the moment. Yeah. I enjoy it. It\\'s always been a s ### Human: Oh, cool. ### Assistant: And our other uncle played for us for a few years. ### Human: Oh, wow. ### Assistant: So football has been in the family-- ### Human: Strong in the family. ### Assistant: --for a long time. Yeah. ### Human: Are they on your mom\\'s side or your dad\\'s? ### Assistant: They\\'re on my dad\\'s side. ### Human: Okay. Cool. Yeah. ### Assistant: We\\'d always be kicking the football around with cousins and all that sort of stuff. So football has really been in the family. ### Human: From the start, yeah. And do your uncles give you tips and stuff like that? ### Assistant: Yeah, they did. We don\\'t see them a lot anymore because it\\'s a bit hard coming to school and finding time, especially when one of them lives in town. And so it\\'s a bit hard. But we keep in contact. And when they\\'re down, we\\'d go watch the match. And we\\'d go get tickets, and we\\'d see them after the game, that sort of thing, so. ### Human: Oh, cool. ### Assistant: Yeah. We try to see them as much as we can, I guess. ### Human: Yep. Yeah. Awesome. And that sounds like, yeah, it\\'s been an important part of your life so far and, hopefully, your future with the dream to play AFL. ### Assistant: Yeah. We\\'ve got to really work hard because it started off with 180 kids in the squad. I think it\\'s down to 80 or something. ### Human: Wow. ### Assistant: And only two get drafted. ### Human: Oh, gosh. ### Assistant: So it\\'s a big competition. So to make it all the way to 18s-- only two get drafted, which is pretty-- it would be-- ### Human: A tough competition? ### Assistant: Yeah. Especially when you look at all these kids, you have no idea how many people are out there that are really, really good footballers, so. But yeah, we\\'re just going to have to work hard and hope I get there, hopefully. But yeah, I\\'m really excited to get back into the swing of things. We started school on the 31st as well. I\\'m pretty sure. So going back into school, I think, the 31st, Tuesday, I think-- ### Human: Okay. Oh, I can\\'t remember back now. ### Assistant: So yeah, I think I got back to school, and I was doing sport already with friends and then also doing the sport sessions at school as well. ### Human: Yep. So-- ### Assistant: So yeah, I got really hammered with sport, but I enjoy it. I guess you got to enjoy it to do it. ### Human: Yeah. I mean, it\\'s normal, though. You really enjoy some parts of it, and you might find it a bit overwhelming as well. Is that kind of what you experience? ### Assistant: Sometimes I feel like I get swallowed with sport. It feels like I\\'m always doing it, which I don\\'t complain about. But sometimes by the end of the week, I get home, just lie down because I\\'ve done so much sport. ### Human: Exhausted. Yeah. ### Assistant: But-- ### Human: Does your body get really tired? ### Assistant: It gets very sore, especially coming off school holidays. But my muscles are sort of getting used to running around and that sort of stuff. But the first day coming back from school, I was so sore. I could hardly walk. ### Human: Oh, no. ### Assistant: Yeah. But I\\'m getting used to it. Yeah. It took, I think, two or three days to get used to it. I couldn\\'t walk for a long time, just get home, sit on the couch. And that\\'d be it. ### Human: Yep. Yeah, fair enough. ### Assistant: So-- ### Human: It sounds pretty exhausting. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I enjoy it. And it gets me doing things so I\\'m not always at home. And sometimes home can get really boring when you\\'ve got nothing to do. Sitting in front of the TV, playing video games, it gets really repetitive, especially when I come home every single day and play it. Especially just over the school holidays, that was all I did, so it got a bit boring, but. Yeah. ### Human: Yep. Is it just you and your twin brother in your family? ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: Yeah. And her kids? ### Assistant: So it\\'s dad, mom, dad, and I. And at dad\\'s house, it\\'s dad\\'s girlfriend with her three kids. ### Human: Three kids, wow. Okay. ### Assistant: She\\'s got a fourth, but he doesn\\'t come around a lot. ### Human: Okay. He doesn\\'t live there? ### Assistant: No, he doesn\\'t live there. Only two live there. Two girls live there, and the two boys live at their dad\\'s. Yeah. That\\'s how things are familywise at the moment. Mom\\'s planning on moving closer to here. dad is in college. So mom wanted to move closer there. ### Human: Okay. And I understand you\\'re moving out of your family home - is that right? - to move there. ### Assistant: Yeah. So we move out of there, and we move, hopefully, closer to home, maybe a bit further out. I\\'m not sure. And I think dad stays in there. I\\'m not 100% sure. I think he will, though. Yeah. I think that\\'s been the past three weeks so far, talking about moving, looking at the house, that sort of stuff. ### Human: Are you helping your mom look at places and stuff like that? ### Assistant: Well, mom wants to build. And so she\\'s looking at working out our room and what the house is going to look like, all that sort of stuff, what things will look like entertainmentwise like the TV, couches, beds, what bed we want, yeah, all that sort of stuff. ### Human: Do you like being involved in that process, or how does that feel? ### Assistant: I guess it\\'s a bit-- I don\\'t like to bring it up a lot. Because we\\'re moving out of the house I\\'ve been in-- I have no idea. I think I\\'ve only been in there for-- I think I\\'ve only been in there 15-- I think I\\'ve only been in that house for 14 years. ### Human: 14 years, yep. ### Assistant: I think we lived in it for a year. I\\'m not 100% sure. Yeah. Yeah. It\\'s all right. But I know that it\\'s just what happens, I guess. I\\'m not too fazed about it. I guess you don\\'t have to-- the house isn\\'t really something. It\\'s just who lives in the house, I guess. So that\\'s how I look at it. ### Human: So your home is with your family, as opposed to in that particular house. Is that what you mean? ### Assistant: Sort of the house isn\\'t a part of us, so it\\'s sort of just something that we live in. It\\'s not something that if we move that house, everything is going to-- but things do change, but it\\'s not going to be the end of the world. ### Human: Yep. Sure. ### Assistant: As long as it\\'s just seeing mom and dad, I don\\'t really care where I live or what I do. So yeah. ### Human: Yep. So the important thing to you is that you\\'re still spending time with your mom and dad-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --regardless of where you\\'re physically living. ### Assistant: Yeah. Where I\\'m living doesn\\'t really matter. But it\\'s whether or not I see mom and dad all the time. So yeah. ### Human: Is that a worry at the moment, about whether you will see mom and dad enough, or are you--? ### Assistant: We do go to court soon - I\\'m not 100% sure - to figure out housing and also living, so how many days we spend with mom, how many days we spend with dad, whether we live at mom\\'s, whether we live at dad\\'s. So we\\'re just going through that sort of stuff. Yeah. I think after that, it\\'ll be a bit easier because we\\'ll finally figure out what to do with the house. And it\\'ll, I guess, become a lot clearer than muddled up like this and what about this and all that sort of stuff, so. ### Human: It\\'s up in the air at the moment. Is that why it feels a bit muddled? Because you\\'re not sure when you\\'re going to be-- ### Assistant: Yeah. The-- ### Human: --back and forth? ### Assistant: --moving and all that sort of stuff has been going on for ages. Ever since, we moved schools. So yeah, it\\'s been sort of there, but I\\'m not 100% sure when, where, what dad\\'s going to do, that sort of thing. So it\\'s sort of-- we know what mom\\'s going to do. We\\'re just not sure what dad\\'s going to do. ### Human: In what way do you mean that? ### Assistant: Well, when dad gets the money for the house along with mom, I\\'m not sure what he\\'s going to do. He\\'s going to move house. That\\'s just a bit, in that way, muddled. We\\'re not 100% sure what will happen, so. ### Human: Okay. So from, yeah, selling the house, your mom and dad are going to split the money. And you know your mom\\'s plan is to move near your school and maybe build and set up your home again. And then with dad, you\\'re not sure whether he\\'s going to move house or stay where he is or something. ### Assistant: Yeah. Because they\\'re renting at the moment. So whether or not he buys a house or he waits until his girlfriend gets the money for her house, we\\'re not 100% sure yet. So all things are a bit muddled up at the moment. So what happens with dad, we don\\'t know a lot. But with mom, we know a fair bit of what she wants to do, which I guess makes it easier because you know what\\'s happening with mom. It\\'s just finding out what dad wants to do. I don\\'t know what dad-- I don\\'t even know if dad know ### Human: Okay. Yeah. Have you talked to him about it, or are you just kind of waiting to see what happens, or is it easy to talk to him about that stuff or not really? ### Assistant: I was going to wait until it comes around to selling the house. So when mom\\'s organized, time to put the house up for auction, all that sort of stuff, I guess I\\'d speak to him about-- speak to him about it then, what he\\'s doing, what his plans are, that sort of stuff, so. ### Human: Yep. So you\\'re waiting till then? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep. Yeah. Do you kind of-- it sounds like it\\'s much easier to know the plan. And with mom, it is a bit clearer. And with dad, you\\'re kind of working out when it\\'s best to talk to him about it and that kind of thing. Does that kind of stress you out, not knowing what\\'s going to happen? ### Assistant: Just a bit, not a lot. I know when things become a bit clearer, we\\'ll get a bit more of an understanding of what\\'s happening with mom and dad. But at the moment, it\\'s not exactly clear what\\'s happening. Yeah. When things start happening and that sort of stuff, I guess, yeah, we\\'ll end up finding out what happens then, hopefully. ### Human: Yep. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You seem quite calm. You\\'ve got a pretty mature-- you\\'re looking at how that\\'s going to unfold. Is that how you feel? ### Assistant: I just know that-- ### Human: . patiently. ### Assistant: --things were not working out in the end. There are things I don\\'t know, whether it\\'s going to be the way it is, so. But things never can be the way it is. It would always be different. Yeah. Things won\\'t always be muddled up and not knowing that sort of stuff. It\\'ll end up becoming a bit clearer. And things change, and they don\\'t always go very well, so. ### Human: Yep. So you kind of-- yeah. A lot of people don\\'t kind of realize that. If they\\'re going through a challenging time with things going on, lots of people feel like that might last forever. But it sounds like, yeah, you\\'ve got this insight that you know it is quite muddled at the moment, but it\\'ll settle. It sounds like you\\'re quite confident that it\\'ll be okay. It\\'ll settle in a way that it\\'ll be okay kind of thing. ### Assistant: Yeah. I guess when mom and dad are happy, things will start getting a bit happier. And I think when dad finds a place, when mom builds and all that sort of stuff and finds a place to live, all that sort of stuff, things will start becoming happier, and people won\\'t be so flat like it has been. Some days, you get dad. He\\'s really flat and happy. And mom, you get days that mom\\'s flat and happy. And it\\'ll be a lot clearer, I guess, when we go to dad\\'s, when we go to mom\\'s, that sort of thing, s ### Human: The schedule. ### Assistant: --what happens there. And that\\'ll make things happier as well. So when we know where we\\'re living, if we\\'re going to live at mom\\'s or dad\\'s-- I guess what I\\'m trying to aim for is to get-- looking fortnight, get one week with mom, one week with dad. ### Human: Yep. That\\'s what you\\'d like to do? ### Assistant: Yeah. And I\\'d like to live with mom. But I guess it\\'s up to-- dad and I have different reasons where we want to live and that sort of stuff, so. But it\\'ll work out in the end. Actually, I know it\\'s all going to work out. Because when we end up moving house, that means that mom can move on. And then when dad gets the money from the house-- yeah. When dad gets some money from the house, he\\'ll end up going around-- we\\'ve got to start looking at where we can-- if he wants to buy or he jus ### Human: So do you feel that the house thing, that all would make a big difference for your mom because she\\'ll feel like she can move on from what\\'s happened? Is that what you mean? ### Assistant: Yeah. When mom moves house, she\\'ll sort of go-- she\\'ll sort of move on, start at the new house. And when dad gets the money, and where we\\'re going to live, what are we going to do with the money, that sort of thing, so. Yeah. ### Human: So you think, yeah, things will get better when those things happen, kind of. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep, yep. And I didn\\'t quite catch what you were saying about your aim to have a week with mom, a week with dad. But then you were also saying you wanted to live with mom. Did you mean full time, or? I didn\\'t quite catch that. ### Assistant: Well, I was looking at a fortnight that I\\'d be at mom\\'s for the first week and the second. So I would be living with at mom\\'s and alternating between dad\\'s, not living at dad\\'s, alternating between mom\\'s. ### Human: Okay. So your home base is more at mom\\'s and then a week at dad\\'s. ### Assistant: Yeah. My home base would be more at mom\\'s house, and I\\'d be going to dad\\'s. ### Human: Yep. Yep. And you and i have different opinions about that. ### Assistant: Yeah. He wants to go and live with dad. He can\\'t do that at the moment. So yeah, we\\'re just going to have to see, I guess. ### Human: Yep. Okay. Yeah. And how you were saying about people feeling a bit flat and stuff, I was just curious. How have you been feeling? ### Assistant: I have days where I really can\\'t be bothered. But that\\'s rarely. Also, with mom and dad and me, sometimes they get days that they really get angry. They get tense, or they get sad. And they just get flat, or they don\\'t want to talk at all. I get a few days like that where I just can\\'t be bothered talking to anyone. I just want to do my own thing. Yeah. My paranoia sort of plays off a bit. So I\\'m always tired. I guess I\\'m never flat and unhappy. It\\'s just I\\'m always tired, which may c ### Human: Yep. Okay. So yeah, you don\\'t feel flat or unhappy, but you just feel tired? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep. Okay. Okay. And what you were saying about the paranoia, is that what you\\'ve been speaking to me about, worrying about going out and being attacked or that sort of thing? ### Assistant: Yeah. Things have just been going on for ages. I haven\\'t really taken a lot of notice of it. I can\\'t sit outside. I see shadows. I can\\'t go outside at night. Noises at night inside the house really scare me. And I go to bed when I physically can\\'t keep my eyes open, which is normally about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and waking up at 6:00 in the morning. So I don\\'t get a lot of sleep. ### Human: Oh, not enough sleep at all, yeah. ### Assistant: So I think one time, I stayed up all night because I couldn\\'t go to sleep. ### Human: And was that because of the worries about the noises in the house, that sort of thing? ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. I have a big worry. I make sure doors are locked, make sure windows are closed, that sort of stuff so no one-- I have a big fear of someone being inside the house. It\\'s just something that I\\'ve had for a while and the shadows and the noises. I feel like people are touching me. I feel like someone\\'s breathing on the back of my neck, all that sort of stuff. Yeah. It really, really plays off a lot. So yeah, it just makes me tired. I\\'m falling asleep in class. So yeah, it drains me a ### Human: Yep. Is that easy because it\\'s daytime, sleeping on the bus? ### Assistant: I can sleep during the day. Noises during the day-- I just can\\'t be alone outside. ### Human: Okay. In the day as well? ### Assistant: Yeah. But otherwise, I can walk with anyone. I can go outside if someone else is outside and can see me. I can do a lot more in the day. I can sleep during the day. Noises, I don\\'t really take much notice of. It\\'s more at night which I really struggle to get to sleep. ### Human: Yeah. Sure. Yep. And you said that\\'s been going on for ages. How old were you were when it started? ### Assistant: Jeez. I think it\\'s been going on for five, six years. ### Human: Five or six years? ### Assistant: 15. Maybe at nine. ### Human: Since age nine? ### Assistant: Yeah. I think so. That\\'d be six, seven years, maybe. At least six years, it\\'s been going on for. ### Human: Yeah, way long. ### Assistant: I haven\\'t really taken a lot of notice of it, so. It\\'s gotten worse as I\\'ve gone on. It started off with shadows and then went further on to not being able to sleep, and the noises really frighten me, and it\\'s gotten to the point where I cannot go to sleep. Sometimes I\\'d just be able to ignore the noise. I\\'d be able to ignore it and just go to sleep. And that happened for a while. And it\\'s been, I think, past three and a half years that it\\'s been really bad, the fact that I have to be physic ### Human: In class and class? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. That\\'s a bit rough. What if you fall asleep in class? Does that cause problems? Do you get in trouble or anything? ### Assistant: I get behind. ### Human: Get behind, yeah. ### Assistant: I sort of miss out on the information that I need. If I\\'m feeling tired during a class we\\'re not doing a lot, I sort of tend to-- yeah. I sort of tend to write slowly and sort of really-- I can\\'t be bothered. I hate that sort of stuff. It really makes me feel even more tired. So yeah, it doesn\\'t happen a lot anymore because of how much sport I\\'m doing. It sort of wakes me up a lot or keeping me awake because I\\'m doing a lot. Yeah. So we\\'ll eventually find a way to, hopefully, get rid of i ### Human: Yeah, to be able to sleep and-- ### Assistant: Yeah, to be able to sleep and that sort of stuff, be able to go out at night without all the fears like coming down a dark alleyway. I couldn\\'t even step down a dark alleyway, that sort of thing. Even alleyways during the day, I can\\'t do. Even with someone there, it\\'s just-- yeah. Yeah. It\\'s just those sort of things that sort of-- I can\\'t walk home at night if I was from somewhere, from my friend\\'s home. From my friend\\'s house, I need to walk home. I couldn\\'t, that\\'s sort of thing. So it so ### Human: Yep. So yeah, that limits your independence and, yeah, just being able to do stuff that you want to in a more carefree way, kind of. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep. Okay. Thanks for telling me a lot about what\\'s been going on. Yeah. I feel like I got a lot better understanding from talking to you than just from reading notes and stuff from other sessions. Yeah. So it sounds like there\\'s kind of working out or waiting for things to kind of clear up at home and managing with mom and dad and your brother, feeling a bit flat or in different moods at times, and then also managing your whole lot of sport that you\\'re doing. And then there\\'s this sort of p ### Assistant:  ### Human: You were looking forward to it, moving. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. There are a lot of minor things that I don\\'t tend to worry about, so. Yeah. Dad living with his girlfriend, that sort of stuff, they\\'re minor things that I can live with. I\\'ve gotten used to it. So I\\'m not as skeptical and that sort of stuff. It was a bit weird at the start, but I\\'ve gotten used to it. Yeah. I just have to live with it because I don\\'t want it to happen. It\\'s going to happen maybe with mom. I\\'m not 100% sure. But it was eventually going to happen with either both ### Human: Yep. Okay. So you feel like you\\'re kind of getting more used to your dad\\'s partner. It felt a bit inevitable that maybe one or both your parents might find a new partner? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep. Okay. And was that something that-- how did you feel, initially, about that idea? ### Assistant: A bit weird. Someone else coming to your life, sort of getting used to them, it\\'s very different, whether or not you\\'re going to get along with them or not. I know a really close friend. His mom met someone else, and it\\'s been absolute hell for him. So I was coming to that-- because his mom and dad split before my mom and dad split up. So you\\'re going to their house. It\\'s like, \"Jeez, is that going to happen to me?\" ### Human: You\\'re worried about that. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. It got better. I sort of got to know her a bit more. We went to school with her kids. We know them. They\\'re local too, so. Yeah. ### Human: So that\\'s settled for him. So is that part of why you are like, \"Oh, things will settle for me as well,\" or is that just quite a positive view on life, it sounds like? Is that more generally? ### Assistant: Yeah. I think it\\'s more of a positive view. ### Human: Yeah. Cool. Cool. I just looked at the time. It\\'s a little bit past 5:00. So I should probably let you go for the day. You probably already had a long day at school as well. ### Assistant: Yeah. No, it\\'s all right. We did a lot of sport today. We\\'re going to Sovereign Hill on Monday. ### Human: Oh, that\\'ll be fun. ### Assistant: Yeah. So we get-- ### Human: Have you been before? ### Assistant: --to look at how food, sweets, and candy and lots of stuff are- ### Human: Oh, yeah. That is fun. ### Assistant: --made and refrigeration over the years, what people ate because we\\'re doing it for food science. So we\\'re looking at the science behind food and what kind of fats you need, all that sort of stuff. So that\\'s where we\\'re going. We get to buy a few souvenirs. up there, which will be cool. ### Human: Are you panning for gold as well? ### Assistant: I\\'m not sure. I\\'d like to. If we don\\'t, I\\'d like to go back up there again. And I think we do get time to do that sort of stuff. I think there\\'s a mine that you can go down, and you find little nuggets. I\\'m not sure. But we don\\'t get to do that. But I think we do get to do things. But if we don\\'t get to do that, I can always go up with mom or dad and all that stuff. So yeah, I\\'m looking forward to it. ### Human: Yeah. That sounds really fun. I\\'ll be interested to hear about that. Cool. Yeah. Maybe next session, we can have a think about maybe-- because we\\'d start with like, \"Cool. Why do we focus on so much?\" And I feel you\\'ll give me a pretty good picture to start off with at least. Maybe we can decide on where we want to start next week as well in terms of some of that problem-solving if you want to or whatever. How does that sound? ### Assistant: It sounds good. ### Human: Yeah. Cool. All right. Thanks so much for coming in and being so open to chat with me today. You did very well.  All right. Well, shall we head back out? And did your mom bring you today, or? ### Assistant: Yeah, mom brought me today. ### Human: Okay. Cool. Yeah. All right. ### Assistant: I think I\\'ve got to wait for him. I think he might be-- ### Human: Oh, what time does he finish? ### Assistant: I have no idea. ### Human: I\\'ll find out soon. ### Assistant: I think he finishes later than me. I\\'m not 100% sure, but I\\'ll find out. ### Human: Yeah. still working, hopefully. we can check that later. So I thought because we haven\\'t seen each other for a while, maybe we\\'ll do more of a catch-up, check in, see what you\\'d like to work on. What do you think? ### Assistant: Sounds good. ### Human: Sounds good. she updated me on the chat you had with her two weeks ago today. ### Assistant: I think it was two weeks ago. Yeah. ### Human: Anything you want to update me on, or you want to focus on today? ### Assistant: This is always hard. ### Human: It\\'s a hard question, isn\\'t it? ### Assistant: Things to update and work on. Not a lot has gone on since the last time I saw him. I was talking about football. ### Human: Yes. That was on my mind, that you might update me on football. Yeah. ### Assistant: I got onto another squad for football. So even more football training. ### Human: So update me on the routine with football because she was explaining it to me, and I was like, \"I think i will have to explain this again, so it makes sense.\" ### Assistant: Well, at the moment, Tuesday is Calder Cannons here in town. ### Human: Calder. And what level is that on because you\\'ve got a few teams, don\\'t you? ### Assistant: Yeah. So Calder Cannons is going to TAC cups and that sort of stuff. ### Human: Yeah. TAC cups. Yeah. ### Assistant: And then we\\'ve got-- ### Human: And that\\'s training on a Tuesday. Yeah. Yeah. ### Assistant: Wednesday is normal-- so normal club football in japan. ### Human: Okay. Club football, yeah. Yeah. ### Assistant: Thursday, I believe-- ### Human: You\\'re very busy. ### Assistant: I believe Thursday is going to be-- because we\\'ve got into-- normally Thursday wasn\\'t anything, but I think Thursday\\'s going to-- because we got accepted into the NFL. So our club football is the Northern Football-- ### Human: Okay. And is that you also, and yourself? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. Just checking it is the same, or if it\\'s one of you. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. So the NFL\\'s the league that our local football club\\'s in. I think that\\'s on a Thursday. I\\'m not 100% sure. ### Human: We can always change it around. ### Assistant: Yeah. Friday\\'s club football again. ### Human: So far. Yeah. ### Assistant: So that\\'s just training. ### Human: And that\\'s training. So that\\'s training for Wednesdays and Fridays. ### Assistant: Yeah. And coming up-- won\\'t be for a while though, but Sunday\\'s normally the time when we play club football games. ### Human: Club football games. Yeah. ### Assistant: But that\\'s further into winter, so. ### Human: So that\\'s it. ### Assistant: And that\\'s further into March. ### Human: Starts March. Yeah. ### Assistant: Around about there. I think we have a practice match in March somewhere. ### Human: And is all this practice year long, or is it there\\'s breaks and it\\'s-- ### Assistant: So Calder Cannons won\\'t go through winter football season. ### Human: It doesn\\'t. It doesn\\'t. ### Assistant: So it doesn\\'t. It goes through summer and spring. ### Human: Spring. Yeah. ### Assistant: And autumn and winter, they seem not to do it. They do most of it when it doesn\\'t clash with club football and that sort of stuff. So-- ### Human: Yeah. So do a lot of people that play club football also-- a part of the Calder Cannons, or is-- ### Assistant: Yeah. So what happens is you get invited. So people go out and look at your club, and you get invited down to Calder Cannons. And-- ### Human: Yeah. This is what he was explaining to me. ### Assistant: Yeah. And then they have-- they start off with a bunch of people, and then it gets down to a smaller group, and then a smaller group, and then a smaller group. And I think it gets down to a team. So I think it gets down to about 25 or something like that. And then 2 from there gets drafted to an NFL team. And then you play TAC cups. And then if you\\'re good enough, then you go to play at AFL. ### Human: So that\\'s training for the TAC Cup, and they\\'re breaking it down. Yeah. Yeah. ### Assistant: So that only runs-- I\\'m pretty sure it only runs through summer and spring. It might run through autumn. I\\'m not sure. ### Human: Yeah. Because you\\'ve got summer, spring, and that\\'s a new thing. ### Assistant: That was Calder Cannons and leading up to TAC Cup has been out there for a while. The only new thing that we knew about, I think it was the day after I came and saw it, I found out that I was in the NFL squad. ### Human: Yes. So how long have you been in the Calder Cannons for? ### Assistant: I\\'ve been in there for-- since last year I\\'ve been around about-- jeez. ### Human: So 2016 or \\'15. ### Assistant: It was 2016. I think it was close to the end of the year. Might have been September. ### Human: Yeah. September. Yeah. ### Assistant: Might be even earlier than that, but I think that\\'s around about when. It\\'s a bit confusing because I\\'ve got so many football dates already. ### Human: Yeah. That\\'s why I wrote it down for my own, just to be able to separate the different ones. ### Assistant: Yeah. So Thursday and Monday and Saturday-- ### Human: And Monday. ### Assistant: --and Sunday at the moment are all free. ### Human: So if we do that, Thursday is a question mark, and Saturday is a-- ### Assistant: Yeah. Thursday\\'s not sure, and Sunday at the moment is, but getting further into winter is when Sunday will become club football, which is good. I\\'ll start getting back into football. I enjoy playing because this is normally when-- coming back from holidays, I haven\\'t done a lot of exercise. And then it comes back to here, and it\\'s hard. You\\'re all into it and that sort of stuff, but yeah, it\\'s good to get into running and that sort of stuff and playing footie, which is always good. And that ### Human: Yeah. How does it help with school stuff? ### Assistant: School stuff. So I have three sessions of sport. Well, not three sessions of sport. I have three days. ### Human: Yeah. And did you choose three days of sport? ?? ### Assistant: What happens is we get electives. So we get to pick certain sports and certain subjects that you want to do. I decided to do-- so I\\'ve got two electives. The two electives are on Tuesday, so today, and are also on Thursday. ### Human: Yeah. So you have them twice on Tuesday, twice on Thursday. --- ### Assistant: Yeah. So I\\'ve got a double session on Tuesday. So that\\'s two sessions. And then I\\'ve got two sessions again on Thursday. And-- ### Human: And what are the electives? ### Assistant: The Tuesday elective is PE body works. So sort of looking at muscles, bones, how they work, and that sort of stuff. And then Thursday is-- that\\'s sport and recreation. ### Human: Sport and rec. Yeah. ### Assistant: So that\\'s looking at hosting events and all that sort of stuff. Sport in general. So what sport you do. And Wednesday, we\\'ve got three sessions, which are the last three, and we have team. So this is where we have people that go into teams, and we visit other schools. ### Human: Oh, so I forgot. Is there a technical word for it still? I\\'ve forgotten what it was called. ### Assistant: Interschool sports. ### Human: That\\'s interschool sports. Yes. Yeah. The name hasn\\'t changed. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. So that\\'s what we do on a Wednesday, and that\\'s compulsory for everyone. ### Human: And so if you don\\'t like sport, you still have to play sport with interschool sports. Yeah. ### Assistant: Well, you try out for a sport. And then if you don\\'t want to play a sport, there\\'s a thing where you stay back at school and do games and still do sport, but you\\'re not going to other schools and that sort of stuff. So-- ### Human: So obviously, you would be in the teams. Just a guess. ### Assistant: Yeah. right. It\\'s a bit boring being there because it\\'s mostly the people that don\\'t like to play sports and not necessarily trying. So I-- ### Human: It\\'s not their thing. ### Assistant: --at least want to try and do stuff. So I try to get onto as many teams as I-- well, I try to get onto a team. ### Human: Yeah. What team are you in? ### Assistant: I\\'m in hockey boys. ### Human: Hockey. How do you find hockey? ### Assistant: It\\'s interesting. ### Human: Very different to-- ### Assistant: It\\'s certainly different from football with all the hitting and all that sort of stuff. The power, it\\'s in here-- the muscles in here. Flicking the ball and hitting. Yeah. It\\'s interesting, all the different rules. I\\'m used to contact and-- ### Human: Because there\\'s no contact in hockey, isn\\'t there. Yeah. ### Assistant: --kicking, in hockey you\\'re not allowed to. I mean, you\\'re not allowed to push. You\\'re not allowed to-- you can bump, but you can\\'t come in and take them out and that sort of thing. There is a bit of-- there\\'s certain boundaries to contact. You can if you\\'re going for the ball, and you accidentally bump them a bit, but if you come in and knock them out of the whole thing, and then take the ball, that\\'s against you, and the ball\\'s given to them. And you\\'re not allowed to touch it with your fo ### Human: When you\\'re used to using your feet. ### Assistant: When you\\'ve got the stick on the ground, it sort of flicks up, and your feet are in the way. And you\\'re not allowed to stand on top of the ball, that sort of stuff. Yeah. It\\'s very, very different from what I\\'m used to because I\\'m used to going after the ball and that sort of stuff. Getting thrashed around and that sort of stuff. ### Human: Nicer word thrashed around. ### Assistant: Yeah. You can\\'t touch it with your hand and all that sort of stuff. If it touches your-- because you\\'ve got shin pads so if it touches your shins and that sort of stuff. There\\'s a lot of rules involved in it. So yeah, it took a bit to get used to. ### Human: What made you choose hockey? ### Assistant: Mom played it, and Mom\\'s side cousins play hockey as well. Sometimes when we go up there, they\\'d be hitting around the hockey ball on a Sunday. So sometimes we\\'d play with the hockey ball, and I think I picked it up from there. It wasn\\'t that hard. I got moving the ball around and hitting and all that sort of stuff, but yeah, so. ### Human: It\\'s a nice reason to give it a go. ### Assistant: Yeah. Not our fault that I don\\'t do school football. ### Human: And why is that possible? ### Assistant: Purely because I\\'m a year-- so I went to school earlier. So I was-- ### Human: You\\'re start of the year. You were born start of the year, so you went up a year, or you went a year earlier? ### Assistant: I went a year earlier. So I\\'m a year younger than other people. So these guys are turning 16 this year, while I\\'ve turned 15 at the start of January. ### Human: Yes. Yeah. So I was exactly the same, with a year earlier because I\\'m a January baby. So everyone\\'s turning a year later, and you\\'re like, \"Yeah. I\\'m next year.\" Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. And it\\'s hard with football because what the school does-- all the school does is you\\'ve got-- 7s play by themselves. 8s and 9s play together. 10s, 11s, and 12s --- ### Human: 10s, 11s, and 12s. ### Assistant: Because I\\'m in year 10 this year. So we\\'re up against year 11 and 12. So basically, I\\'m at year 9, going up against 10s, 11s, and 12s. So they\\'re much-- ### Human: Yeah. So you could almost be against 18-year-olds. ### Assistant: Yeah. They\\'re much bigger than me, and I don\\'t play that because of that. Because they\\'re older than me, like a year, I\\'ve been-- in micro football I\\'ve always played a year above, so it\\'s not that hard, but playing against people that are like two, three years older than me, it\\'s a bit harder too, and they\\'re massive. We\\'ve moved down to our own age group this year, and hopefully, we stay down. I\\'ve gone from people being up here to being people around about here. So all of a sudden one of ### Human: And it sounds like that\\'s-- ### Assistant: --a little bit more important, I guess, than doing school football because I guess then-- ### Human: That\\'s what I thought you might say. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. The school football sort of doesn\\'t set me up for if I wanted to do football after I leave school and that sort of stuff, so. ### Human: Is that what you\\'re thinking, or is that--? ### Assistant: Well, if I do well in Calder Cannons and do end up getting up to the varsity squad, most likely you can play for Cannons and slowly , I\\'m pretty sure until you get drafted, So-- ### Human: So could you get drafted at 15, or you need to be 18? ### Assistant: I think you need to be-- you need to be 18 to be able to get drafted. I\\'m not sure. It might be 17, 18. I\\'m not 100% sure, but I know that two people do get drafted at the end of the year in 18s or 17s. So-- ### Human: And you\\'re playing under 15s or 16s? ### Assistant: Yeah. I\\'m playing under 15s this year. ### Human: Under 15s. Yeah. ### Assistant: So with Calder Cannons, you have to play in your own age group. So there\\'s no advantages and there\\'s no disadvantages with age and size and all of that sort of stuff. So at the moment, we\\'re in under 15s. So we\\'ve got a while to go, but what they do is after a few months, they\\'ll look down with all the people at Calder Cannons and go, \"All right. These people are really good. These people are all right. And these people are struggling to cope with all this sort of stuff.\" So then they drop i ### Human: Wow. That\\'s 100. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. They\\'ve done a lot of cuts and a lot of people have gone. ### Human: And what\\'s the catchment area? Do you have to live in it, or how does it--? ### Assistant: The Calder Cannons is-- so there\\'s Calder Cannons and then there\\'s Northern Knights. I think the cut off of doing it is-- I don\\'t think you can go past them. I think that\\'s the outskirts of Calder Cannons because I\\'m pretty sure you and i are now Northern Knights. So I think that is as far as you can go. I\\'m not sure how far that stretches out both ways. I think people in town-- so there\\'s northern knights that are in Calder Cannons. So no, I\\'m no ### Human: Needs to be so that they can figure out who goes where. ### Assistant: Yeah. There\\'s certain clubs that go, and I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s due to living as well. So wherever you live, I guess, that\\'s how far. Yeah. It\\'s not so much-- it\\'s with playing at the club and how far you are away from that club. So yeah, but I\\'m not sure how far that spans out though. I\\'d be interested to know. But yeah, there\\'s heaps of local people from there that are as far out as here, I\\'m pretty sure. ### Human: That\\'s a big distance. ### Assistant: There\\'s some people from school, and I\\'m pretty sure there\\'s other people, but everyone has got different teams. So some teams aren\\'t-- they don\\'t have a football team. I\\'m pretty sure the only football team they have is the seniors, which is 18s and up. So-- actually, I think it is them. I\\'m not 100% sure, but yeah. So at the moment, if I do well with Calder Cannons and I keep going and keep sticking with the group, most likely looking out of there, football is ### Human: And what\\'s that about, that you\\'ve got to have a rebound? ### Assistant: Football back then, my uncles did football, and at the-- ### Human: Uncles. So more than one. ### Assistant: Yeah. They didn\\'t have to have-- so back then when they were doing it, schooling wasn\\'t such a big thing back then. People sort of saw it as if you\\'re good at football, you\\'re most likely to be a football player. And if you didn\\'t make it, well, then you had to find something else, and that made it hard. And when he went on to play in the TAC Cup when he finished school and that sort of stuff, he doesn\\'t have any education at all, so he doesn\\'t have a job or anything. So he\\'s basically relie ### Human: Having a backup. ### Assistant: --there\\'s a big thing about schooling amongst our stuff now in football. So Calder Cannons encourage us to do well at school, and at the moment, with how much stuff I\\'m doing, there\\'s only a few days I get where I can come home and do homework and all that sort of stuff. I do say to my teachers, \"Look, I\\'ve only got this amount of days,\" and i go down to two. Probably, it\\'ll only go down to three, and probably down to two at the moment if Thursday does become AFL training. ### Human: Yeah. Because then it\\'s Monday and Saturday. Yeah. And what are the teachers like around supporting you? ### Assistant: They say, \"Do as much as you can on those days after school, or if you need, do it at lunchtime,\" which, yeah, I\\'ve got to find time during lunchtime and that sort of stuff to balance out school and sport. ### Human: Would that be helpful for next time to sit down and do a bit of a timetable to see what it looks like for you, where you fit everything in? ### Assistant: Yeah. Well, at the moment-- ### Human: Just as a thought. You can say, \"No. I\\'m not thinking that all could be helpful.\" ### Assistant: And there are a few things that I\\'m behind on. A few assignments that I haven\\'t been able to get done because of football. I guess it\\'s hard when you do sport, especially the amount of sport I\\'m doing. ### Human: And how many hours do you do? Just for me to get my head around. ### Assistant: So Calder Cannons goes from 5:00 till 6:30. And club football goes 5:00 till 6:30. ### Human: 5:00 till 6:30. Yeah. ### Assistant: NFL one, I\\'m not sure about. And the other club football on Friday is the same time. And Sunday, normally games. I\\'m not 100% sure. I\\'m pretty sure about four quarters, I think. The last time it was 20-minute quarters. So probably looking at an hour and something. What? ### Human: So if they\\'re 20-minute quarters-- ### Assistant: There\\'s 20-minute quarters and there\\'s four of them. ### Human: So 80-minute duration. ### Assistant: That\\'s 80 minutes. Yeah. So that\\'s probably about an hour and 20. ### Human: So at least an hour and a half. ### Assistant: Yeah. Almost. ### Human: 80 minutes. ### Assistant: I think that gets up-- I\\'m not sure how many minutes we have. No. Because I\\'ve gone down. So we have the exact same. Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. 80 minutes. ### Assistant: I think. I know last year because I\\'ve stayed-- so last year I was under 15s, and this year I\\'m playing under 15s again. So I\\'m pretty sure it stays like that. I think the older you get the more changes you get on the ball and all that sort of stuff. So more times you come on the bench and that sort of stuff, and the higher it gets, I think they\\'re looking at 25-minutes or something like that. So when you get older, they get-- I think when you get to about 18 it\\'s 30-minute quarters and all ### Human: That\\'s a much longer game. ### Assistant: Yeah. And that\\'s, I think, what AFL-- I think AFL is close to that as well, so. But yeah, they get pretty long, but you get changed a lot more and that sort of stuff. So yeah, I think it\\'s probably about an hour and a half almost you\\'re looking at. ### Human: Yeah. With the break and what. So 90 minutes. And then when you finish at 6:30, what time do you get home? ### Assistant: Normally the time we get home-- how long would it take you? By the time you leave , it\\'s about-- I\\'m not sure. I\\'m not sure how far the football stadium is because that\\'s where we play, and that\\'s where they play TAC cups and all that sort of stuff. I think it\\'s around about 7:00ish. ### Human: 7:00ish. Minutes to get home? ### Assistant: It might be about-- ### Human: Take about an hour to get home. ### Assistant: Around about 6:50, 7 o\\'clock I\\'m pretty sure. So around about 7 o\\'clock we get home most of the time. And then straight after that, Mom makes tea, which we\\'re looking at about-- normally Mom has stuff made. So it\\'s probably about 20 minutes. So we start probably eating around about 7:30 each football night. ### Human: Yeah. And then what happens after you eat, like the rest of the night? ### Assistant: Normally either we watch TV or-- we either go to bed, depending on how tired I am. ### Human: What time\\'s bed? I\\'m pretty sure we spoke about it, but I don\\'t remember. ### Assistant: Normally, most times bed\\'s around about 9:30, depending on how tired I am. ### Human: So looking at that, there really isn\\'t that much time to even fit in homework if you wanted to. ### Assistant: And yeah, so it\\'s really hard, especially because most of my people at the school I go to now, they-- ### Human: Most of my people. I like the wording. ### Assistant: Yeah. Most of my classmates, they only do two days of sport a week, and because I\\'m doing so much, it\\'s really hard to catch up on homework and all that sort of stuff, and assignments and all that sort of stuff normally take an hour max. Some of them you have to do two or three pages of work and all that sort of stuff. So it does take a while to do stuff, and by the time you have tea, and you go to bed again. ### Human: So sometimes you\\'ll do assignments on the football nights. Is that what you\\'re saying? ### Assistant: Not really. I normally do it around about Monday or Thursday-- ### Human: Which makes sense. Yeah. ### Assistant: --depending on due date. So that sort of limits time as well. If a due date\\'s on a Thursday, then I\\'ve got Saturday, Sunday, Monday. That\\'s really about it. But if it\\'s two or three weeks, I get the allowed time to do it. I\\'m sort of looking at enough time to get stuff done. ### Human: Yeah. You work it around. ### Assistant: So a bit on-- when I get home, a bit on Monday, a bit on Thursday, a bit on Saturday, a bit on Sunday, and keep doing it, and I normally get to around about finishing assignments, but at the moment, yeah, it\\'s hard, especially the fact that there\\'s so much homework to do normally. ### Human: And how much is there to fitting it in? How do you find how much they give you to realistically how much you can do? ### Assistant: Most teachers, knowing that I do do a lot of football, they normally give me a bit more time. So they\\'ll extend it out, but it\\'s a bit hard with the weekends because I\\'m not 100% sure if we\\'re going to go out for the day or we do something else on the weekends. It doesn\\'t help that some weekends-- so every second weekend we\\'re at Dad\\'s. ### Human: Yeah. Is it the same arrangement as you said last time, or is that four days at Dad\\'s, the rest at Mom\\'s, and then it alternated? ### Assistant: It was Wednesday-- yeah. So there\\'s Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday morning. That\\'s what it is at the moment. So at Dad\\'s, don\\'t have any internet to do all the research and that sort of stuff. So that limits how much I can do. ### Human: So there\\'s no internet at Dad\\'s at the moment. ### Assistant: No. And we only get the mobile data on my phone, and I normally only get two or three bars when I work. So it\\'s a bit hard to do research and all that sort of stuff, especially on the little screen and-- ### Human: Yeah. Is there an option of having the internet, or that\\'s not happening at the moment at Dad\\'s? ### Assistant: At the moment, yeah, it doesn\\'t look like it\\'s going to happen anytime soon, but hopefully, it does. I know that most definitely internet at Mom\\'s. So I can do it most weekends. Obviously, it limits if we go out or not. So sometimes we\\'ll go out for the weekend to eat, and we\\'ll go out on a Friday night or something after school-- I\\'m sorry. After training. And then we\\'ll go out for the weekend and come home around about Sunday night. So that really-- ### Human: And where do you go? ### Assistant: --takes out my-- normally, sometimes we go out and see cousins or something. That normally happens. So we go out sometimes on a Friday. Now, having football, we\\'d go out Friday after school. Sometimes you go out on a Saturday, Sunday. And then yeah, you\\'d get home around about after tea. So probably about 7:00 sometimes, depending on where we go to. Some days we might go to school. Sometimes we might go up to school. ### Human: min. ### Assistant: Yeah. So yeah, it\\'s just because we go up to cousins and see family. Not every weekend, but some weekends we arrange to go up and that sort of stuff. So that does take out weekends, but normally the teachers are pretty lenient of how far they go. ### Human: And are they similar from this school to the last school with supporting you? ### Assistant: The last school, they didn\\'t really bother about homework. Even-- ### Human: So that\\'s been a bit different. ### Assistant: Even going into year 12, they didn\\'t really worry about homework and all that sort of stuff. You don\\'t really learn a lot during class, but here, you do a lot of homework, and you do a lot of learning during class. So it\\'s going from-- because I had two years and primary school. I didn\\'t even get homework and all that sort of stuff. So having two years of not doing work at school and having no homework, going to now, I\\'m looking at my second year at this school. Doing a lot of homework. It\\'s ### Human: That routine. ### Assistant: Then to do whatever you want, then come home again, do some little bit of homework. But back then, I wasn\\'t doing as much football. So I\\'d only do club football on a Wednesday and a Friday. So that opened up a bit more days if I was to do homework to do homework, but now, yeah, it\\'s yeah, really hard. So yeah, I will find time to do it. It\\'s just at the moment it\\'s a bit hard when-- ### Human: To get used to it too. ### Assistant: Yeah. When club football comes around, that\\'ll free up Tuesday. ### Human: Yeah. When club football-- ### Assistant: So when club football starts up, Calder Cannons will say, \"All right. I\\'ll see you.\" ### Human: Yes. That\\'s Tuesday. Yeah. Because that\\'s a Wednesday. ### Assistant: So they don\\'t like clashing up with club football. So they go, \"We will stop Tuesday.\" And then most likely, you come back around about-- oh, when do we finish club football? Close to the end of winter. When would that be? ### Human: So club football\\'s not on at the moment. ### Assistant: We\\'re only doing training. ### Human: Yeah. And that\\'s when the games are on backwards. Yeah. That makes sense. ### Assistant: At the moment we\\'re doing what they call preseason. So we\\'re doing training before. ### Human: Yeah. Preseason. So currently, it\\'s preseason. ### Assistant: Yeah. And then we\\'ll start getting into training. So start getting more kids to turn up to training and all that sort of stuff. So it starts to get into the season. And then after you finish club football, and then Calder Cannons starts back up. So basically, when club football starts up, Tuesday\\'s free. And then when Calder Cannons starts up, club football finishes. So that frees up Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. But at the moment, the days I\\'ve got free is Monday, Thursdays-- ### Human: Yeah. Depending on-- ### Assistant: --- or-- ### Human: Yeah. We\\'ll put a question mark. ### Assistant: And Saturday and Sunday at the moment are all free. But yeah, coming into winter, days do get pretty full, and not knowing when NFL is on and all that sort of stuff. ### Human: When will you find out about that NFL? ### Assistant: I do see Dad Wednesday. We go back to his place after football training. So I\\'d ask him about what\\'s happening with that. I don\\'t even know if he does know what\\'s happening at the moment. So we\\'ve just got to play it by ear and see what happens. Who knows. It might be on a Friday, or it might be on a Wednesday. I don\\'t know. It might even be on a Saturday. ### Human: Yeah. You\\'ll find out what it is. ### Assistant: Yeah. We\\'ll eventually find out when it starts up. ### Human: Does it start up-- is it March or is it later? ### Assistant: All I know is that I\\'m in. Dad thought it would be Thursday that we\\'d train. He\\'s not 100% sure though. So yeah, we\\'re not 100% sure. So all we know is we\\'ve gotten in, but yeah, that\\'s it at the moment, so. But yeah. ### Human: Has it been helpful talking about football and explaining it? ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. It\\'s a lot easier to know what days I\\'ve got free because sometimes I go home and go, \"All right. Have I got football training or something?\" ### Human: yeah. Yeah. ### Assistant: And normally, every time a teacher gives me an assignment or something, I will say, \"Look, how long is it?\" And they\\'ll go, \"Oh, it\\'s, let\\'s say, three weeks,\" or something. And I\\'ll go, \"All right. Well, these days I can\\'t do it because of football. These days I\\'m only looking at doing them.\" So at the moment, it\\'s the weekends and Monday and Thursday. It will soon fill up a bit. So yeah, I can\\'t guarantee that I might get it very detailed and all that sort of stuff. I try to do it-- if I\\'m ### Human: Is that-- ### Assistant: --year 11 and 12, I know at this school they do a lot of homework. So you do like-- ### Human: min. ### Assistant: --four or five nights a week of homework, which if football still does continue, it will get harder and harder because that means I\\'ve got to do four or five nights of homework. If I don\\'t do stuff in class, I\\'ve got to catch up on it and that sort of stuff, so. ### Human: Is that something you\\'d like to focus on next time? ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. Figuring out what days, what times I can do homework and all that sort of stuff. ### Human: So I can print out some-- would you rather a three or a four? Sorry. Double? ### Assistant: Maybe even a four. ### Human: A four. This size of it. Some young people prefer bigger sheets. We\\'re just checking it and printing out either. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. It\\'d be good to know that sort of stuff because I wouldn\\'t say I\\'m very organized. I\\'m sort of organized. I do know what days I have this, what days I can do that, and all that sort of stuff, but it\\'s got to do with habit because I haven\\'t had that habit. I sort of go, \"Oh, I\\'ve got homework there. No. I\\'ll leave it for a while.\" And then I get caught up in something else, and be like, \"Oh, you know what? There\\'s homework there, and I\\'ll do it another day.\" And then I get to the ### Human: And getting used to it. ### Assistant: Getting into a habit and all that sort of stuff, so, but it helps to have done it at the start of high school, but it was all at the other school at home. You\\'d get to school, and you\\'d hardly do any work. And then you\\'d come home, and you\\'d have no homework at all. So it was-- ### Human: So it was very different to me. ### Assistant: Yeah. Very different. So yeah, there\\'s just a difference between, and most of the kids, they get to year 12 at school, and they go, \"Oh, I haven\\'t to do all of this homework.\" And then they get overwhelmed and all that sort of stuff, but these kids at school go, \"Oh, we\\'ve got homework in year 12. We\\'ve got a lot of it. I know I can set this out and do all that sort of stuff. I can tell which days I\\'m going to do this.\" But yeah, it\\'s a bit hard when most of these kids aren\\'t very sp ### Human: Yeah. It\\'s very difficult. ### Assistant: Most of them are very academic and all that sort of stuff. So there\\'s only a few really sporty people. So because I\\'m doing so much football, it\\'s-- and they go, \"Why do you do that much of sport? How can you do that all the time?\" And they sort of go, \"Oh yeah. I did it. Did you?\" And I go, \"No. I haven\\'t had time,\" or I lost track of what I was doing, or I got too unorganized, and I forgot to bring it home, or I decided I\\'d do it later, but I end up didn\\'t. Yeah. Yeah. I\\'ve just got to get ### Human: You know what you need to do. It\\'s just getting all those bits and pieces together to get there. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. So I do remember that I\\'ve got homework. It\\'s just at the end of the day, I\\'m tired. I want to go home, or I\\'ve-- full of energy and I need to get home for football training, and I\\'ve got to prepare and that sort of stuff. So I sort of get caught up in other things, and because I haven\\'t had that habit of doing homework all the time, I get caught up in, \"Oh, this homework, I\\'ll leave it in my locker. I\\'ll do it another day.\" Or I\\'ll bring it home, and it\\'ll sit in my room, which happen ### Human: All that in effect. ### Assistant: Yeah. I don\\'t have to do more work for doing just that little bit. So yeah, all I\\'ve got to do is plan out what days I have this, what days I have that, what days I can do homework, and yeah, I\\'ll eventually get the hang of it. ### Human: And is that something you\\'d like to do together, plan it out? We can do that next time. Good plan because it seems like just getting into that routine at the moment\\'s tricky because with school holidays not that long ago, and just adjusting to year 10. Your sport commitments, and fitting in school. ### Assistant: Yeah. Because straightaway I got to school, and then we started up February 10th. We started up Calder Cannons. So we go back to school on the 31st of January, and then all of a sudden, bang. I\\'m back into exercising. So my body was physically drained because my muscles hadn\\'t been running and all that sort of stuff because I didn\\'t do a lot over the holidays, and my body was getting used to running and all that sort of stuff. And then coming back to Calder Cannons, it was even more sport. S ### Human: It\\'s great you\\'ve got that insight. This is what\\'s gone on, and then what you can do to change it. That\\'s really good. ### Assistant: Yeah. Because I know I\\'ve spent a lot of last year worrying about Calder Cannons because Calder Cannons was really big. ### Human: Yeah. A huge thing for you. Yeah. ### Assistant: I know it\\'s big-- I know it\\'s big for me now still, but it was really big. It was like, \"Oh, I need to focus on this because this is what\\'s going to take me to AFL if I do well,\" and that sort of stuff. And then I sort of went, \"No. School. I\\'ll go to it every day. I come home,\" and that sort of stuff, but sport was like, \"I come home from school, and I\\'ve got to do this. I\\'ve got to well,\" and that sort of stuff. So I sort of left school behind. But this year, with even more sport commitmen ### Human: And so your stress doesn\\'t go up either. ### Assistant: Yeah. But this year I\\'m sort of getting more into football. I\\'m more into football. Sort of getting closer and closer to football, but I\\'ve sort of got to find the middle, where I can focus on school and focus on sport, which I haven\\'t found at the moment. I\\'m leaning more towards sport, which most of the time I think about it, \"Well, when do I have football training?\" Or when I\\'m doing my sport electives at school and all that sort of stuff, I go, \"All right. I\\'ve got sport now. I\\'ve got to ### Human: We can-- ### Assistant: --football is then higher. So I sort of leave the ones that I go, \"No. That doesn\\'t matter. I think I won\\'t need it in the future.\" I go, \"No. I won\\'t need you. I won\\'t need you,\" and I put it down at the bottom, and I go, \"Oh yeah. I like you. I\\'ll bring you up.\" And then I bring that other one up. And then I have football, which is on top, and then it goes down in the-- ### Human: That hierarchy you have. And we can talk more about it next time because we\\'re going to have to finish up in a moment. Is there anything else you really wanted to talk about that was pressing? ### Assistant: Not really. No. It\\'s just all to do with school and sport. I\\'ve got to find out-- ### Human: School. Yeah. That makes total sense it would be. ### Assistant: --what I can do to help. I thought that I had it under control but looking at all the sport that I\\'ve got now, when I went over it a few weeks ago, I went, \"Jeez. I\\'ve got a lot of sport. Haven\\'t got a lot of time for school.\" ### Human: Well, let\\'s work together to try to fit both in because it sounds like that\\'s something you do need to do. Fit them both in. When\\'s the next time that works for you to come in, or should we check with Mom? ### Assistant: I\\'ve got another appointment with you. ### Human: Yeah. She was telling me-- ### Assistant: With my sessions, I\\'m pretty sure it was. Yeah. I\\'ve got Thursday the 2nd of March at 4:15, and Tuesday the 7th of March at 9:00 in the morning. So that\\'s so far with me. So yeah, those days I\\'m 100% sure, but I think Mom was going to give headspace a call to organize another session for this. ### Human: Yeah. We can do that. ### Assistant: But I know that these sessions we do, and I think after that, we don\\'t go back for another six months or something. I\\'m not 100% sure. I think that\\'s what Mom said for these appointments with me, and the doctor as well. ### Human: Yes. Yeah. And then we\\'re weekly to fortnightly, depending on what you\\'re feeling we would need. So if you\\'d like it to be next week or the week after, totally up to you. ### Assistant: Yeah. I\\'ll speak to Mom about it and that sort of stuff. ### Human: Yeah. Is Mom here, or is Mom gone? ### Assistant: Mom was just going to-- Mom\\'s dropped us off and is going to pick us back up again. At what time? Yeah. She is. ### Human: Pop out. ### Assistant: m. We\\'ve still got school to go back to. ### Human: Yeah. So we\\'ll-- ### Assistant: Which I don\\'t particularly want to go back, but I know I have to. ### Human: We\\'ll finish up with-- ### Assistant: Relax, and then go back into football, but once again I\\'m just doing what. ### Human: I need to. ### Assistant: You all good? Hopefully, I don\\'t get the background music. ### Human: You all good? Hopefully, I don\\'t get the background music. ### Assistant: I think it was on last time. ### Human: Yeah. The soundproofing isn\\'t the greatest between the two walls, and sometimes I can completely block it out, and it\\'s not there. Other times, you can really hear-- depending on the sound-- ### Assistant: It\\'s not you-- ### Human: --probably. ### Assistant: --can\\'t hear it out the door, so-- ### Human: No. You can\\'t. no. You go, \"Where\\'s the sound coming from\"? because you\\'ve got some-- ### Assistant: I thought it was coming from next door last time. ### Human: No, definitely straight from behind from the gym. ### Assistant: Wow. It\\'s just the fact you can be down there-- in some of those rooms there, and you can\\'t hear it at all, and you get up here, and you\\'re like, \"Whoa, jeez, that\\'s actually really.\" ### Human: Well, it\\'s quite loud, so I can\\'t imagine how loud it is in the actual gym if we\\'re hearing it. ### Assistant: And it\\'s sort of soft. Sort of like it\\'s coming from next door-- ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: --where you\\'re playing it at a normal tone. ### Human: Yes. And it\\'s coming. ### Assistant: But normally, gyms do have really loud music. ### Human: They do like to have loud music, and sometimes it\\'s okay. Other times, it\\'s-- personally, I feel it\\'s questionable sometimes. ### Assistant: Kind of place does not have-- it\\'s not bad music, at least. ### Human: It\\'s not bad, yeah. ### Assistant: Places enjoyable to listen to instead of having really bad stuff in the background talking. ### Human: We don\\'t want really bad stuff. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: What would you like to chat about today? ### Assistant: I think I\\'d go forward with the homework situation. That\\'s where we\\'ll start. ### Human: Yes, yeah, just wanted to check if that\\'s still wanted to do or if you wanted to do something different. I brought the timetable we wrote out last time to check if it\\'s the same, or if things have changed in two weeks. And then-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --I\\'ve got two options to see what you would prefer more. Do you prefer that way or that way? Hour, or just morning, afternoon, evening. ### Assistant: The hour one looks-- ### Human: The hour one? Yep. ### Assistant: --a bit late, so. ### Human: Some young people prefer this one and not this one-- that one, so I thought I\\'d run it by you. And we can start that. ### Assistant: Sweet. ### Human: All right. I think it might be an American one because it starts on a Monday, which sometimes I find is easier anyway because then the weekend is together. ### Assistant: Yeah, because it goes down with the-- I can\\'t remember how old I was when I first looked at the calendar. I looked at it and said, \"Why does it start with Sunday?\" That\\'s a bit weird. And you get older, and sort of you look at it, and you go, \"Oh, Monday,\" and thinking that you always need it for as a school day Monday was the start of the week. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: I thought when you looked on a calendar it\\'s Sunday, Monday. So when you\\'re looking at it, you should go, \"Ah, it\\'s Sunday.\" And you look, and you go, \"There\\'s no date on that,\" because sometimes-- ### Human: That\\'s right. ### Assistant: --it has Sunday blank, and then Monday would be the first. ### Human: Yes, yes. ### Assistant: You look at it, and you look at Sunday and go, \"Why doesn\\'t that have a number on it?\" And then you look around and, \"Ah, that\\'s Monday.\" ### Human: That\\'s right, yes. ### Assistant: I could get used to the fact that Sunday\\'s the start of the week instead of Monday? And that\\'s sometimes when I\\'m writing down stuff, I always go Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. ### Human: It kind of makes more sense because it\\'s school days, workdays, and then weekend together. ### Assistant: Yeah. School day and working and lots of stuff, and then Saturday and Sunday\\'s the end of the week where you sort of relax. But it\\'s actually the fact that Saturday, Sunday-- it goes that Sunday\\'s the start of the week-- ### Human: That\\'s right. ### Assistant: --which I find confusing. Why wouldn\\'t they make Friday a weekend? I\\'m like, Friday, Saturday, and then Sunday, and school day Monday because you\\'re looking forward-- ### Human: Oh, yeah, yeah. ### Assistant: --to those days. ### Human: That would make more sense. ### Assistant: Or we\\'d keep Friday, Saturday, Sunday the weekend, and that\\'s for all-- ### Human: There\\'s nothing wrong with that, three-day weekend. ### Assistant: --and you just do more during the week. I\\'d find that cool because-- ### Human: You\\'d prefer that? ### Assistant: --that means I\\'ve got-- because I\\'ve got three days where I have to wear a sport uniform, and only wear-- have formal uniform once. ### Human: Because I think I\\'ve only seen you in your sport uniform, yep. ### Assistant: I have it on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, so. ### Human: Yep. That would\\'ve been the days I\\'ve seen you. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Thursday, I think, was the last time, yeah? ### Assistant: Mom don\\'t tend to go with Mondays and Fridays. She finds it easier to do Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and that\\'s just how-- see, I\\'m always in my sport uniform on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I think I\\'ve only came here on a school day with my sport uniform on. I can\\'t remember. ### Human: I think so. I don\\'t remember seeing you unless you\\'ve seen me. ### Assistant: I can\\'t remember. I think I\\'ve seen you on sport uniform as well. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever-- I think I\\'ve probably come here once when I\\'m in formal uniform. I don\\'t know who-- ### Human: Sport uniform is more comfy? ### Assistant: --yeah. You don\\'t have to wear the school socks, and there\\'s-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --better shoes and lots of stuff. And the T-shirts where you move around, and you have a-- ### Human: They\\'re sticky, yeah? ### Assistant: --and so it feels like it\\'s sticking, or it\\'s hard to move. ### Human: And you put a tie that you wear too. ### Assistant: We wear that in winter, or it\\'s just getting close to winter. And you have to wear long pants. And you have to wear that in pants, heavier shorts, lots of stuff, so. Yeah. It\\'s getting close-- ### Human: It is. ### Assistant: --close to winter. It doesn\\'t feel like winter, though, but. ### Human: No. It doesn\\'t even feel-- we\\'ve had a summer, but it doesn\\'t really feel like we\\'ve had a summer. ### Assistant: It did sort of-- I actually think this year winter took longer to finish, and then summer kicks in, and then summer\\'s starting to take-- ### Human: That\\'s right, yeah. ### Assistant: --ages to wear off because it\\'s been really hot some days. I know every single time we played school hockey on a Wednesday, yeah. Every time on a Wednesday-- every single time you\\'d go and be-- ### Human: It\\'s been really hot. ### Assistant: --really, really hot. ### Human: And it\\'s usually 30 degrees on a Wednesday. That\\'s the day it just happens to be hot. ### Assistant: I remember it was-- Monday was all right in heat, and then Tuesday was cold-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --and windy, and then Wednesday, it jumped up-- ### Human: A month or so ago-- ### Assistant: --to, I think, it was 27 or something the next day, on Tuesday. ### Human: I remember that week. ### Assistant: And then it hit back to about 41 degrees when we were playing hockey. And we\\'re like, \"Why couldn\\'t we flip that around?\" I think a friend of mine was looking at the weather the next week, and I think it was 28, and then it hit up to about 30 on the hockey-- ### Human: I\\'m not a fan of the heat. ### Assistant: --and then it\\'d be cloudy, and then it was sunny for the Wednesday. And the next week after that, it was sunny on the Wednesday again. So we\\'re like, \"Well, we\\'re pretty not stuffed because we\\'re playing in the heat so much.\" And we only have a few more games, but yeah. It\\'s everything-- ### Human: It\\'s a lot hotter in the heat. ### Assistant: --every single time we\\'ve played, it\\'s been in the heat. We haven\\'t had one cold day, but last time we played, it was a winter sport. So last time we played, it was actually pretty cold, and we wanted warm weather, so we weren\\'t that cold out there, but yeah. Every single time it would be cold. Then it\\'d be cold the day before and then bang. All of a sudden, it\\'d be warmer the next day. ### Human: And you don\\'t get to choose the weather, unfortunately. ### Assistant: And it\\'s nuts, the fact that you go, ah, I wish it\\'d be a bit cooler on that day, but then it happens the day before, and then all of a sudden, it just has to be hot. I don\\'t understand it. ### Human: It\\'s confusing. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: With things, would it be the same for mom and dad or different for when you\\'re at mom\\'s and when you\\'re at dad\\'s? ### Assistant: It would be limiting because-- ### Human: With your entry? ### Assistant: --dad doesn\\'t have a computer. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: He has recently gotten Wi-Fi, which is good. ### Human: Good, because you said last time there was no internet. ### Assistant: There was no internet, yeah. I think it was-- we saw each other on that Tuesday, and then Wednesday when I saw him, yeah. He had the modem but hadn\\'t-- ### Human: Great. ### Assistant: --had the Wi-Fi set up. ### Human: I remember you saying that you weren\\'t sure what was happening if there would be internet there or not. ### Assistant: Yeah. He was paying a lot of phone bills because when we were there, we were using our data on our phones, so we were going over all the time. So he decided that it\\'d be cheaper if he-- because he pays for the three phones, so he pays for his, mine, and mine. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And he thought it would be a lot cheaper because he was using it, and he was going over all the time because he was using it for work and at home. And he thought that getting Wi-Fi, it\\'d be cheaper for the three phones, and it has saved him a lot. We haven\\'t-- ### Human: That\\'s good. ### Assistant: --we haven\\'t been-- we\\'ve had a lot of spare data over, so yeah. He hasn\\'t had to pay over fees. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: We\\'ve actually had 3 or 4 gigabytes because we\\'ve got 11 gigabytes for our phone plan. I think we\\'ve had 4 or 5 gigabytes left over, which is-- ### Human: That\\'s a fair-- yeah. ### Assistant: --a lot still, so yeah. It saved a lot with dad. It helps. So in some rooms of the house, you can\\'t get really good phone reception, especially in my room. Where the weird part about it is, the fact that-- there\\'s a lounge room, then there\\'s my room, and then there\\'s dad\\'s room, and then at the other end of the house, you look, and the next room is the kitchen. There\\'s the laundry there, and there\\'s another room, and there\\'s another room in there, then there\\'s another room. The toilet bathro ### Human: There\\'s a lot of rooms in the house. ### Assistant: Then there\\'s the second lounge room. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: And then there\\'s outside. You get better reception outside. There\\'s my room and the bathroom are the only places you don\\'t get good reception. I don\\'t understand it-- ### Human: Of course, the room-- ### Assistant: --because where my room is, there\\'s the bathroom. So I\\'ve got dad\\'s bathroom on one side, and there\\'s my bedroom, then there\\'s another room, and then there\\'s the bathroom off that. ### Human: Where\\'s mom\\'s room, or you--? ### Assistant: But yet-- there\\'s my room here. ### Human: Would you like to draw it? Is that easier? ### Assistant: Yeah. It would be. It\\'s hard to explain because you sort of go on one side of the house, and then you\\'ve got a mirror. It sort of-- ### Human: I\\'ve got a rough idea, but if it\\'s easier just to-- ### Assistant: --yeah. It\\'s a bit hard to explain , because there\\'s so many rooms in the house. So whether it is this part here, of the house, which is dad\\'s room, and then you\\'ve got the lounge room in here. I\\'m trying to picture to make sure. So the lounge room is here sort of, and then there\\'s my room, yeah. So the front door is here. ### Human: Yep. The lounge room on-- ### Assistant: So this is the lounge room area. This is my room. This is dad\\'s room, and then you flip over. There\\'s a wall here. Then you\\'ve got the kitchen here. Then you\\'ve got the laundry here. Then you\\'ve got a bedroom there. You\\'ve got the little dining room area. You\\'ve got the bath, yeah. You\\'ve got the bathroom. ### Human: You said one\\'s in a room? ### Assistant: How big is the-- so I know you\\'ve got another room here. You\\'ve got the toilet because this is sort of-- if you look at it when you come into the dining room area-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --there\\'s the-- yeah. There\\'s the other lounge room here, and then there\\'s-- ### Human: The two lounge rooms and dining room? ### Assistant: --yeah. There\\'s a wall here. Well, a short wall, and then there\\'s-- yeah. Yeah, it is. So you\\'ve got-- that\\'s way confusing. So these two rooms are the same. They just look a bit weird. ### Human: Yep. That\\'s the same, yeah, yep. And you\\'re-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --here? ### Assistant: I\\'m here. So I\\'m-- ### Human: Yep, put a star by it just-- ### Assistant: --here, and it\\'s here. ### Human: Okay, yeah. ### Assistant: So I\\'ll do a star, and it will be a star. ### Human: Sure. ### Assistant: And so I\\'ll be the star. Anyway, I know that there\\'s the toilet here, and then the bathroom\\'s here. So that\\'s-- ### Human: Okay. ### Assistant: --what it sort of looks like. ### Human: Yep, because I think the bathroom is-- no, that\\'s the laundry. ### Assistant: So dad\\'s bedroom. The main living. My room, kitchen, laundry. ### Human: That was a bedroom, so that\\'s the bathroom. ### Assistant: That was a bedroom. That was a bedroom, again. It sort of goes like that-- ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: --and that room. So the wall here, there\\'s a room. That room, that door-- so that\\'s sort of is a wardrobe here. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: So that sort of ends up like that and that, and there\\'s a wall there and sort of goes off like that. So that\\'s sort of the gist of the room, and then there\\'s a wardrobe in here, so that\\'s the two rooms, the same. There\\'s a wall there. Then you\\'ve got the-- that means the bathroom would be here. ### Human: Yep. That\\'s right. That\\'s what you said. You said-- ### Assistant: Yeah. That is the-- ### Human: --toilet there. ### Assistant: --toilet. The toilet would be sort of here. That means this bedroom wouldn\\'t be as big, and that would be the bathroom. So this area here would all be carpet. Then you got a bathroom. There\\'s the door there and there, yeah. That makes more sense. ### Human: Yep. So the toilet\\'s in the bathroom, or is it separate? ### Assistant: It\\'s separate, which is-- ### Human: Separate, okay. ### Assistant: --good. So that you can-- ### Human: That\\'s a good thing-- ### Assistant: --use-- ### Human: --good having it separate. ### Assistant: --yeah. And obviously, dad\\'s got a bathroom in there, so it\\'s sort of-- ### Human: Yep, like an en suite. ### Assistant: --yeah. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: So I\\'ve got the-- yeah. That\\'s the main layout of the house, and then that\\'s the garage here coming off, and then this is a little outside area, so there\\'s a sliding door there. So the modem is set up on the kitchen bench here, and before we had the modem, my room and the toilet were the only ones that didn\\'t have good reception, but yeah. There\\'s a bathroom, and we can just do a toilet because that makes it easier, and that\\'s another living. ### Human: Yep. The main living, and then the others, yep. ### Assistant: Then there\\'s outside, then there\\'s dining room table area. ### Human: Yep. And that was the garage there. Is that right? ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: So these are the only two rooms that didn\\'t have good reception, which how that works-- ### Human: That\\'s really interesting-- ### Assistant: --is weird. ### Human: --because there\\'s nothing left. ### Assistant: Because we\\'ve got 4G on our phones. And 4G, it goes down to 3G 1 bar, 3G 1 bar, and it has 4G 4 bars, 4G 4 bars everywhere else. But you get 4G 5 bars here, in the laundry room. You got-- ### Human: The best? ### Assistant: --4 bars in there. 5 bars in there, 4 bars, 4 bars, 4 bars, 4 bars, 4 bars, 5 bars. How that works? I think you also get 5 bars there. You get 5 bars there. It\\'s the only day you get 3G, 1 bar. 3G, 1 bar, and then 4G 4 bars-- ### Human: Okay, yep. ### Assistant: --everywhere else. How that works? I\\'ve got the-- ### Human: That\\'s the way it is. ### Assistant: --dining room. ### Human: Let\\'s kind of add that into where-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --the homework fits in. Do you want to-- ### Assistant: They did put a desk in because the table that dad bought when dad and dad\\'s girlfriend, which we call her stepmom. They-- ### Human: So you call her stepmom? ### Assistant: --yeah. ### Human: Yep, just so I\\'ve got the names. So I\\'m saying the same thing. ### Assistant: Yeah. Dad says that, at the moment, they\\'re probably looking at-- that\\'s how it\\'s going to be. That\\'s how they are looking at it so that he just gets us to-- instead of saying, dad\\'s girlfriend. He just says to say stepmom, and that makes the stepbrother. ### Human: How do you feel about that? ### Assistant: I just look at it as that\\'s it. If mom ends up falling for someone else, it just happens. I know that it\\'s happened with a bunch of my friends. It\\'s happened with cousins, and they\\'re all divorced. So their dad\\'s remarried and have had two other brothers to this dad. So there\\'s their dad, which is our side of the-- dad\\'s side of the family, so it\\'s dad\\'s brother, which is our uncle and was our auntie. And they had two kids, and then they split up, and she hasn\\'t bothered to find any ### Human: Yeah, on that side? ### Assistant: --kids that happened out of their mom\\'s side and had two extra-- yeah. Two little brothers. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: So yeah. They dealt with it at a much younger age. I think because there\\'s a difference between. I know that the eldest, that\\'s the one that has the really curly hair because their mom had really frizzy hair. She gets it-- I think it\\'s chemically straightened. ### Human: Yes. Yep, you can definitely do that. ### Assistant: I think she gets that because it was too hard to manage. I know she doesn\\'t-- but yeah. It was-- I forgot what I was going to say then, yeah. She\\'s 15, turning 16 this year. I\\'m pretty sure. And then I think, the little brother-- I think he\\'s about-- oh, jeez, I don\\'t know his-- I think he\\'d be about, maybe-- how old we were? Are we? Yeah. We\\'re 14. ### Human: How old are you? ### Assistant: I get so mixed up when I\\'m talking about ages. I don\\'t even remember. What am I? I\\'m 23rd January 2002. I will be 14 this year, yes. ### Human: You just turned 14 a few months ago? ### Assistant: Yes. ### Human: Yep. You did, yes. ### Assistant: It\\'s so confusing because-- ### Human: Remember your age. ### Assistant: --I would be-- yes. I\\'d be turning 15 this-- ### Human: Next year. You just-- ### Assistant: --if I was the right age, I\\'d be turning 15 this year. ### Human: --into year 10, 16 into year 11-- no. ### Assistant: No. I\\'d be 16 in year 10. ### Human: 16-- you\\'re in year 10. ### Assistant: Yeah. I\\'d be 16 in year 10. ### Human: No. You\\'re in year-- ### Assistant: If I was the right age, I\\'d be 16 in year 10. 17 in year 11. 18 in year 12. ### Human: Yeah. And you\\'re in year 9. ### Assistant: So I must be 15. Oh, my God. I have no-- I get so. When people ask me-- because I don\\'t get asked my age very often, and my birthday. So when people go, \"When were you born?\" I go, \"I\\'m born in 2002.\" Sort of asking them. Sort of sounds like I\\'m asking them-- ### Human: Do you think you could answer that for me? ### Assistant: --am I? And when people ask me my age, I sort of go, 23rd of January, I am-- and I sort of compare myself to my-- ### Human: Because I think-- ### Assistant: --other-- yeah. I must be-- ### Human: --because I saw you-- ### Assistant: --14. I don\\'t. ### Human: --when you were 14. Was that-- ### Assistant: I must be-- ### Human: --before your birthday? ### Assistant: Wow. I am-- ### Human: You\\'re in year 10, right? ### Assistant: Yeah. I\\'m in year 10, and I\\'m a year younger-- ### Human: So you\\'d be 15. ### Assistant: --than my age. Yeah. I would be. I was 14-- yes. I am 15. ### Human: You are 15? ### Assistant: All right. ### Human: You figured out your age? ### Assistant: Now, we\\'ve got that part down. I am 15 because I know that I\\'m-- ### Human: So you were saying 14. I\\'m, like, but you skip a year in college. ### Assistant: Yeah. So I know he must be 13, turning 14 this year. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Because I know I\\'ve got a younger cousin, on my mom\\'s side, that\\'s a few months younger than us. I think he\\'s the June. June, or it might be later than that. I don\\'t know. I know he\\'s a few months younger than us, but he turns the same age a few or more months later than us, yeah. That\\'d be right, yeah. So we are. He\\'s 14 now, yeah. He\\'s turning 15. All right. Now, we\\'ve established-- ### Human: It was 15? ### Assistant: --I think he\\'s 13, turning 14 this year, yeah. He would be because-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --he\\'s a year and a bit younger than-- no. He\\'d be-- yeah. He\\'d be. He\\'s a year and a few months younger than us, so he must be turning 14 this year. I think it\\'s August. I think, but there\\'s a bit-- ### Human: We\\'ve established you\\'re 15. ### Assistant: --yeah. She\\'s 15, turning 16. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: I\\'m 15. He\\'s 14, no. He\\'s 13, turning 14. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: All right. That was a major deal. I didn\\'t know my own age. ### Human: We figured it out. ### Assistant: When people ask me that question because I\\'m not used to it yet, most of my friends know that I am younger than them, and I sort of compare off my friends. But I\\'ve sort of-- some of my friends are 16 now and turning 17. So they turned 16-- ### Human: So that would be even more confusing. ### Assistant: --so that\\'s even-- because sometimes some of my closest friends can be 16. ### Human: Yes, yep. ### Assistant: And some of them can be 15, and I\\'ve got one close friend that\\'s 16 this year, turning 17. So I sort of-- when I think about them, go, \"They\\'re 16, turning 17,\" or I might go that they\\'re 17. I\\'m a year younger than them. I\\'d be 16. ### Human: 16, yeah. ### Assistant: No. I can\\'t because I\\'m not driving yet, yeah. It\\'s confusing. And some people are 15 this year-- ### Human: Yep. That\\'s all confusing. ### Assistant: --turning 16 later. So when I go, \"I\\'m a year younger than them, so I must be 14.\" No. I can\\'t be because they\\'re turning 16. It\\'s all confusing. ### Human: Shall we get this started? ### Assistant: Yeah. So that\\'s the-- ### Human: We figured out your age. ### Assistant: --yep. Yeah. We figured out the age-- figured out the fact that I\\'m all right with the fact that-- yes, go back to your question. ### Human: Yes. The fact of-- ### Assistant: Yeah. I am. ### Human: --dad\\'s girlfriend being stepmom? ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. I know what happens-- or the thing with the house. The reason why mom couldn\\'t-- nana had to take us, on my mom\\'s side-- had to take us today because mom was working at stuff with the bank and the house, and that just happened. ### Human: Oh, so nana dropped you off today, yep. ### Assistant: Yeah. I know that happens, or it has happened. I know that cousins have said that they really wanted their old house back, but I guess that happens. I know that I wanted dad to come back and live, and I know that when dad ends up moving away, I\\'ll go, ah. I\\'ll wish it. ### Human: Is dad moving away? ### Assistant: He probably going to stay where we are, which is in doubt at the moment. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: He\\'ll probably move-- I know there\\'s a big area of land in town. It might be more expensive. I\\'m not sure. But dad does play a bit of golf, so he might move closer, and he\\'s got a few friends there. ### Human: Yep. What are your thoughts around that? ### Assistant: We\\'ve got a really, really close friend that lives not that far, if we do move there, wherever we move to and if he is going to move in there. I know that most of my stepmom\\'s kids still want to move to california. ### Human: And are they living in this house? ### Assistant: Yeah. Two of them do. Two of them do full time. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: No, not full time. So they\\'re doing a week on and a week off, yeah. So they have one week with their mom and one week with their dad. ### Human: And is it the same week you\\'re with dad, or are they different? ### Assistant: Yeah. They try to get that on the same week, so it\\'s not just us. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And it\\'s not just him, so we sort of get used to each other, which we don\\'t have to now because we used to go to school with two of them. Well, three of them, sorry-- because there\\'s two girls, two boys because one also goes. The oldest boy. ### Human: This is what I\\'m going to do-- if I draw it. I\\'ll get it. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: It\\'s what we usually do. ### Assistant: I think we did it. I think we went through this last time. I\\'m pretty sure. ### Human: We\\'ve done it before, so you\\'ve got-- we\\'ll just quickly do-- mom, dad, and then there\\'s-- who was older by a few minutes? ### Assistant: min. ### Human: m. So I remember asking you that one. So-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --we can do dad, dad, mom, dad, and then mom. Stepmom? ### Assistant: Yep. And then there\\'s-- ### Human: How many kids are there? ### Assistant: So there\\'s four, yeah. There\\'s four. ### Human: Four? Oldest? ### Assistant: There\\'s one. So there\\'re three biological. So three that she had, and one that they adopted. ### Human: Yeah. Oh, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever drawn an adopted child into the family tree. ### Assistant: Because I know that they did originally have three, and then one of the girls had problems with her parents-- really bad problems. She was getting abused and that sort of stuff. So they took her on, and I think they only just recently adopted her. ### Human: Ah, so then there was another female recently. The permanent care is to them now, yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. And then they switch between houses, so yeah. ### Human: And how old is everyone? ### Assistant: So the oldest - I\\'m pretty sure - he\\'s 17. ### Human: He or she? ### Assistant: He\\'s in year 12, so he-- ### Human: Yep. So he\\'s 17. ### Assistant: --would be 17, turning 18. ### Human: Yep. What\\'s his name? ### Assistant: I know he drives, so that makes it a bit easier. ### Human: So he\\'s 18, then-- does he drive on his own-- ### Assistant: Not yet. ### Human: --or with someone? So he\\'s 17. ### Assistant: He\\'s stolen-- yeah. Sorry. I think he\\'s 17, turning 18 because he\\'s in year 12, yes. He would be. ### Human: Next one? ### Assistant: Same age as us, so he\\'s just turned 15. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And then the youngest, I think he\\'s 12. ### Human: Whoop. That\\'s a boy. ### Assistant: He a bit confusing because he\\'s-- ### Human: That\\'s all right. And the-- ### Assistant: --yeah. And she\\'s 16. ### Human: 16. All right, and is that a family member or is it someone that they took into care? ### Assistant: That\\'s someone they took into care. So it\\'s one of-- so this will be confusing, but it\\'s one of our best friends, friends, which is also her friend. ### Human: Her good friend, yep. ### Assistant: Her good friend. ### Human: And the three of these are on a week about? And where do they-- ### Assistant: Yeah. So they are a week with their dad and a week with their mom. ### Human: --yep. And where do they fit in the bedrooms? So you\\'ve got two spare that I remember seeing. ### Assistant: We\\'ve got the-- ### Human: Here you are. ### Assistant: So I\\'ve got me. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: min. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: I guess we could go by names. It makes it easier for me. So there\\'s me, which is the 15-- so the same age as us-- ### Human: Yep. Let me-- ### Assistant: --because she\\'s the same age as us. ### Human: --quickly write that here so I\\'ve got it. yep, yep-- back to you. ### Assistant: And there\\'s blood, yep. Yes. There\\'s blood in that room. So it goes dad-- well, I guess I\\'ll write stepmom. It would make it easier if we just do names because sometimes, if I-- ### Human: Yep. Let\\'s just do names. ### Assistant: --mention. Sometimes if I mention her name, you\\'ll go, \"What?\" ### Human: What, yep. ### Assistant: So there\\'s dad and mom. ### Human: so, yep, that you call her stepmom? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Got it. ### Assistant: So that\\'s the stepmom, coco. And then there\\'s me. There\\'s the lounge room, and there\\'s the laundry. Then there\\'s the-- the laundry is Coco\\'s room, which is our cat. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: She\\'s very cute. Then there\\'s the kitchen, and there\\'s me. The 12-year-old is there. There are only three of them that visit week on, week off. ### Human: And c. ### Assistant: The oldest-- ### Human: what was the--? ### Assistant: --the 16-year-old. And so is the 17-year-old. He comes on and off because he\\'s old enough to make certain choices. He doesn\\'t have to follow things-- ### Human: oh, yeah. ### Assistant: --that their mom and day have made out-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --or have done, so. ### Human: So this will be helpful to have names and where everyone fits in. ### Assistant: Yeah. So that\\'s where the rooms are, but he is in there because he doesn\\'t have a proper room. He was going to take one of the other-- take the garage or take the front living room. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Because we mainly use the main living room instead of everything else, so yeah. It just makes things easier in that way. So yeah. And that\\'s the arrangement. So we figured out the fact that I\\'m 15. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: That I\\'m okay with the fact that everything-- ### Human: With where things are at with-- ### Assistant: --yep. ### Human: --the family system, yeah. ### Assistant: And we\\'ll probably end up doing - I don\\'t know - kind of once a week on, week off with mom and dad. So one week with mom. One week with dad, so we\\'ll probably make the same. I think what we wanted to do was-- that we fit in with mom\\'s-- yeah. That we fit in with mom\\'s family birthdays and dad\\'s family birthdays, and Christmas and that sort of stuff, we have to fit in. So I think week on and week off, we can-- so if mom has a birthday, and she has to have us for that day, we\\'ll just sort of s ### Human: That works well, yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. And we do see dad on training for a few hours. I know we do go back to his place. Yeah. We would go back to his place on a Wednesday, yeah. We would because it\\'s the first week, so what happens-- ### Human: It\\'s week one now. ### Assistant: --is it goes-- I know that on the start of the fortnight, it starts with mom. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And then the second so-- yeah. The second week of the fortnight, we don\\'t see dad on the-- we don\\'t go to dad\\'s house on the Wednesday because we\\'ve only just seen dad on the weekend. So we basically-- ### Human: Yes, yep. So you\\'re with mom. ### Assistant: --have-- so we basically have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday with mom on the second week. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And it\\'s Monday, Tuesday, Thursday after school, and Friday morning. ### Human: Yep. Shall we-- ### Assistant: That\\'s when-- but because we\\'ve got a court order, yeah. ### Human: What\\'s the court order? ### Assistant: So this court order, I don\\'t have a lot about. I know mom was going to talk to us closer to it. It\\'s about-- I\\'m not sure. I think it\\'s about talking more about the house, maybe living arrangements. I\\'m not 100% sure. I haven\\'t been really told a lot about it. ### Human: So that\\'s a wait and see? ### Assistant: Yeah. I know they did organize a date. The court hasn\\'t told mom and dad what they\\'re going to be talking about to inform us. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: So yeah. Mom was going to speak to us. I think, it was Wednesday, yeah. Mom was going to talk to us about it on Wednesday. So we don\\'t know much about it, but I know that we go straight to dad\\'s after the court order, yeah. ### Human: And when\\'s that coming up? ### Assistant: That\\'s coming up this Friday. ### Human: Okay. ### Assistant: So again, we only get three days of school because we had Monday off. We had the long-- ### Human: Of course, yes. Long weekend. ### Assistant: --because it was the-- so we had the Friday off last week because it-- ### Human: Curriculum day. ### Assistant: --was a curriculum day for the school. So it goes, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. ### Human: That\\'s nice. ### Assistant: And we get Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday off. And I know last week, I only had three days of school. So basically, in a fortnight, I\\'ve only had six days of school, which I\\'m happy about. ### Human: Shall we drawn in the plan so I can-- ### Assistant: Yes. ### Human: --understand. ### Assistant: It will make it a lot easier, right. ### Human: It will make it-- and then we can bring it in in the session, so I can see. ### Assistant: So this is what happens in the days, or? ### Human: Yeah. Let\\'s do the days, and then add in where the free times are, which is-- that\\'s what it was. ### Assistant: Yep. I\\'m still not sure on the NFL yet. ### Human: Yep. So we can leave that as a-- ### Assistant: And obviously, someday we will end up getting into trouble, I think. Whoops. I think the game is coming up soon. ### Human: --okay. Shall we do, maybe-- let\\'s draft what it will look like this week, and then we can always go back and redo them. How\\'s that? ### Assistant: Yep. So this will be the first week in a fortnight. I think we\\'ll do this as-- ### Human: Yep. Let\\'s do that. ### Assistant: --because it\\'ll be different with dad-- and if we need to have a separate one for dad\\'s. ### Human: Yep. We\\'ve got, and I can print out-- ### Assistant: We can write that out. ### Human: --more of these, not a problem. ### Assistant: So start with-- so at mom\\'s, and then-- so 7:00, we go to-- ### Human: Well, you can cut out some of the times if it\\'s not completely-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --relevant. ### Assistant: So we\\'re at mom\\'s, and we obviously, going to school-- ### Human: Yep. Plop in school. ### Assistant: --to about-- so mom\\'s in the morning. ### Human: Just put a line down to. ### Assistant: All right. I think it-- 3:00-- ### Human: Yeah, to 3:00. ### Assistant: --so 3:20 finish. ### Human: Yep. So we don\\'t have-- because sometimes, we go through a morning routine of you brush your teeth at this time, this and that, but we don\\'t need to go those details. We\\'re trying to get, where does homework fit in? ### Assistant: Yeah. So we have school till 3:20. ### Human: Yep. And then we\\'ve got-- ### Assistant: And then we\\'ve got footy training on-- not on a Monday. ### Human: That\\'s right. Mondays are a break, yes. ### Assistant: Yep. We normally get home at around about 4:30. I don\\'t know if that would fit more to the 4:00 till 5:00 or 3:00 till 4:00? ### Human: Wherever you feel it? 4:00 to 5:00, probably-- ### Assistant: Yeah. So-- ### Human: --in between. ### Assistant: --it would go 4:30, we get home around about. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: We got to do around about mom. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And then 5:00 just so I won\\'t-- we have determined, and yeah. So all this time we have at home. ### Human: Yep, and what do you do? ### Assistant: Normally, I\\'d either watch stuff and play games on my phone, or I\\'d either play the Xbox because I\\'m looking at getting a computer and-- ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: --getting parts to build it and all that sort of stuff. So I\\'ve been doing that lately. Yeah, just leisure time during that time, so doing stuff at home. ### Human: You can just write leisure time to whatever time. That sums it all up. ### Assistant: Leisure till about 9:30. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: It\\'s bed. I don\\'t normally go to bed around-- don\\'t fall asleep till around about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. ### Human: And what\\'s going on from 9:30 to 1:00? ### Assistant: Just lying in bed. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Just with my paranoid, actually. ### Human: Yeah. And what-- ### Assistant: It keeps me awake a lot, so. ### Human: --tell me some more about that. And we can write in there, and we can even write it on the back if you\\'d like. So 9:00 AM to 1:00 feeling paranoid. What goes on? ### Assistant: It\\'s just lying in bed, basically. Yeah, just lying on my bed. I don\\'t really move around a lot because I\\'m too scared to get out because really-- yeah. It keeps me alert a lot, so. I sort of-- ### Human: Yep. Can I write it down so we\\'ve got it? ### Assistant: Sorry. I fidget with the pen a lot. ### Human: Yeah. You\\'re all right. I was going to say, I\\'ll grab another one, and then we don\\'t have to share pens. That makes it easier. So if we put-- so 9:30 to about 1:00, yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: So try and feel paranoid. What does that paranoid look like? What are you feeling paranoid about? ### Assistant: Any noise sort of wakes me up. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. Any noise or what else? Noise and-- ### Human: So it\\'s hard to get to sleep? ### Assistant: --I see shadows and lots of stuff. ### Human: Yep. What are the shadows of? ### Assistant: Sometimes it\\'s just a shadow of a person-- ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: --or just when people run past me and sort of see a glimpse or something if you see someone who past. ### Human: Now, is that seconds? ### Assistant: Yeah, just a second where it just zooms past me, so I turn around, and that\\'s what I see a lot more of now. ### Human: How often do these shadows come up? ### Assistant: Depending on if there\\'s enough light in my room to create a shadow-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --which there isn\\'t a lot sometimes. ### Human: So if there\\'s enough, yep. ### Assistant: Sometimes, in the dark, I can see glimpses, but if it was enough light in my room to see the full shadow of a person, if not, I\\'d only see little shadows or glimpses, so yeah. That\\'s normally what happens till bed, and that\\'s not much-- and around about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. That\\'s when I can\\'t keep my eyes open. ### Human: Yep, can\\'t keep eyes open. Yep. ### Assistant: Yeah, so. ### Human: And how many times do you see the shadows at night? ### Assistant: It can be twice at the most. I don\\'t see much because-- yeah. ### Human: And is it every night, every few nights, you see them? ### Assistant: Mostly, every night, I see them. ### Human: Mostly-- yep. And when do they start? ### Assistant: Mom normally goes to bed at around about 10:00ish-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --normally, my body starts to shut off at around about 10:00. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Mom makes us go to bed at 9:00. ### Human: Yep. I meant, when did they-- how long have they been going for? When did they begin-- has it been months, years? Sorry. ### Assistant: It\\'s been going on for ages. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. I know I said this with you. I can\\'t exactly remember. I think it was 6 years, maybe. Maybe a little less. Maybe 4 or 5. I\\'m not sure, but around about that-- 4, 5, 6 range-- ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: --because after a while, I just sort of got used to it. I thought it was normal and all that sort of stuff. So I just really didn\\'t bother. ### Human: And it\\'s really common for a lot of young people to see shadows at night. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: I just wanted to double-check to get a better idea of what it looks like at the moment for you. ### Assistant: Yeah. So that\\'s normally what happens, and that happens normally, every night. ### Human: And what do you think the shadow is? ### Assistant: Mostly a man. It\\'s just a person standing there. I have a real-- I hate noises in the night. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Going outside thinking someone\\'s there. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: I just hate the idea of people being around me at night. ### Human: Why is that? ### Assistant: I\\'m not sure. I\\'m afraid of being watched at night or someone being in the house. I don\\'t know, just every time something comes on the news about people jumping into cars and breaking windows and all that sort of stuff-- theft. I know it\\'s happened to mom and dad. Well, mom especially. It\\'s happened when she had a house and went away-- ### Human: How long ago was that, yeah? ### Assistant: --and mom didn\\'t want to stay, so. ### Human: How long ago? Were you alive when that happened? ### Assistant: I wasn\\'t. I wasn\\'t around when that happened. That was when she was a kid. So that was a long time ago. ### Human: Yeah, so before you were born? ### Assistant: Yeah. So I just-- ### Human: And the-- ### Assistant: --yeah. I just have a real-- I just hate the fact of someone being out there and watching or coming into the house or being in the house when I\\'m not there. ### Human: Is that what you think the figures are? Do you think they really are figures, or are they there? ### Assistant: I know they\\'re not there because pretty much, but yeah. They\\'d have to get-- I know that mom goes in there. They\\'d have to get past the dog, which one of my dogs is really protective. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: To say the least-- doesn\\'t allow people to come inside the house. So he\\'s sort of a guard dog, which he isn\\'t meant to be. He\\'s meant to be a sheepdog. ### Human: But he\\'s a guard dog? ### Assistant: Because he\\'s a Kelpie collie, but the Kelp collie, I\\'m not sure. We don\\'t know if that\\'s-- has a bit of guard dog in him or meant to be protective. I\\'m not sure because there are other doggies that are Kelpie-- full breed Kelpie, and she isn\\'t very protective. She\\'s really sheepdogish, so she wants-- constantly energetic and that sort of stuff. So we aren\\'t 100% sure if it\\'s the collie in him that does it because she doesn\\'t do it at all-- or it might just be the boy in the collie, or it mig ### Human: But yours is. ### Assistant: --yeah, because we have a-- on mom\\'s side of the family, some of their workers do have Kelpies, and you can go up to them and pet them and they\\'re both boys. So you can go up and pet them and all that sort of stuff. They run at the sheep. You can go up and pet them, and lots of stuff. They don\\'t really care, so we think it might be the Kelpie, or it\\'s just him as a dog. So yeah. ### Human: A protective dog. ### Assistant: He\\'s a bit weird, though, because all of a sudden, he just started doing it. And we\\'re like, \"What?\" And then when we got-- and then when we got Jessie-- so there\\'s Woody and Jessie. ### Human: Woody and Jessie, yeah. ### Assistant: Dad picked the name of Woody because he was a wood color, and he also, coincidentally, he used to eat a lot of wood. He used to chew on it instead of having chew toys and that sort of stuff. He used to eat and chew a lot of wood because dad being a builder and that sort of stuff-- building decks and that sort of stuff. He had wood lying around everywhere, and I think Woody just found the need to chew it, and that was something that he chewed for a while. Now, he chews all sorts of stuff. And ### Human: Woody and Jessie, yeah. ### Assistant: --and then we sort of went--and I sort of went to mom, \"You know what? Let\\'s think up a whole different name.\" We can say that we just got them both off of Toy Story,  if we really wanted to. And we sort of thought, instead of keeping up a name. It makes it easier. It fits because people have been saying that for ages. What are you, Jessie, off of Toy Story, and that sort of fits? And I\\'m like, \"Why not?\" So she named Jessie, and she isn\\'t very protective. So yeah. We think it\\'s ei ### Human: So we\\'ve got around 5 minutes left. What\\'ll be most helpful to do? ### Assistant: I know that Mondays-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --Thursdays-- ### Human: Yep, write it in. Mondays, Thursdays. ### Assistant: --okay. I reckon we can just keep-- so when we get home, I know that Wednesday, we\\'re at dad\\'s. So-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --4:30 home-- dad\\'s, and then till then, we\\'ve got-- so it\\'s 5:00-- so 5 o\\'clock. ### Human: Wednesday, yep. You had 5:00 to 6:30 unless that\\'s changed. ### Assistant: Training. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Well, it actually will be 6:30, but yeah. It would be. So 5:00-- ### Human: Yep. That\\'s what you were telling me. It was-- ### Assistant: Sorry. ### Human: --5:00 to 6:30. ### Assistant: Under 15s folded in the team. So they don\\'t know when number 15s team-- so we either go up-- so the 16s can make a team, or we find a new club, but at the moment, we\\'re-- but at the moment-- because we\\'ve played our whole life. We\\'ve played with the bunch of kids. We\\'ve always been the young people in the group, and this year, we did-- because we\\'re with the kids. They taught us, from a professional point of view, that we\\'d play down because they fold. And we went, you know what? If ### Human: So you got up to 16s, yep? ### Assistant: We got up 16, so they start at around about 6:30. So we\\'ll put it in here. ### Human: Ah, so this has changed now. It\\'s good to double-check. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: Ah, 6:30. And I think, I\\'m not sure. I think it might be 6:30 too. I\\'m not 100% sure when they finish, but I know that 6:30 is training. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Yeah. So 6:30 is training, and I\\'m not 100% sure. ### Human: And so that\\'s club football. Tuesday was the last. Is that still? ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: Yep. So that\\'s 5:00 to 6:30. I\\'ve got here. ### Assistant: Yep. So it goes, it\\'s 5:00. 00, and then till 6:30. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And then obviously, school is-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --3:20. ### Human: yeah, yeah. You can, exactly, make it as easy as possible, yep. ### Assistant: Probably not here. We go a little bit later because it\\'s a weekend. Why not? ### Human: Of course. ### Assistant: Why not? We always go to bed later on the weekend because you sort of go, no school. Why not? ### Human: You can sleep in, yeah. ### Assistant: So yeah. ### Human: Bless you. ### Assistant: Sort of sneezed and coughed at the same time. Wow.  Yeah. That\\'s all the time. Tuesday, yes. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday-- so we\\'re at mom\\'s again. And then 3:20 finish. Go all the way down. So mom\\'s-- we know we finish at 4:30. ### Human: Same, yep. That\\'s all the same. ### Assistant: And then that would be-- ### Human: Dad\\'s. ### Assistant: --mom\\'s. ### Human: Yep. But you spend Monday-- ### Assistant: And then-- ### Human: --night with dad? ### Assistant: --that would be dad after school. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And then that would be dad, and that would be dad. So that\\'s dad, I guess. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Now that we can know. We can say dad-- because we do nothing, well, sometimes. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: We just sit at home. Sometimes we go-- do stuff, but that\\'s normally what happens. But we know that that\\'s just dad\\'s weekend. We can write that there and keep it, I guess. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: But Thursday, we\\'ve got nothing at all. ### Human: Nothing? And Friday? ### Assistant: Friday, we\\'ve got training at the same time, so 6:30 training. So-- ### Human: Plop that in. ### Assistant: --6:30. ### Human: And let\\'s use that. Where does homework currently fit in? ### Assistant: I don\\'t actually have homework at all fit in. I haven\\'t got a lot of homework at the moment, which is good. ### Human: That\\'s good, yeah. ### Assistant: I haven\\'t figured out what to do after my shift. I should probably write dad\\'s. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And then mom\\'s in the morning, and then-- yeah. We just keep that as dad\\'s. ### Human: Yep. So maybe something-- ### Assistant: But yeah. So that\\'s basically what happens, and we can do the second week another time, but-- ### Human: Yeah. Shall I copy-- ### Assistant: --that\\'s normally-- ### Human: --this for you? And maybe you can see, yourself, where homework could fit in. ### Assistant: Yeah, because I-- ### Human: How does that sound? ### Assistant: --at the moment, Fridays-- obviously, during school till 3:20-- on the bus, it\\'s a bit hard to do stuff. Obviously, friday-- ### Human: It\\'s probably not really realistic. ### Assistant: --training, and all that sort of stuff. It\\'s really hard to do, and yeah. ### Human: Do you want a blank one, also? Will that help, or do you want me to just photocopy that? ### Assistant: It might. Photocopy that because we might for the second week because it changes. ### Human: You can talk more. That\\'s all good. ### Assistant: Yeah, yeah, because it flicks around a lot, so. ### Human: So I\\'ll copy that, and maybe, you have a think about, where it fits now or where realistically you can put it in because we don\\'t want you to go, \"And I\\'ll do homework here,\" and that\\'s not going to happen. ### Assistant: Yeah, because it was probably on the bus. ### Human: And we don\\'t want to stress you out. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: So today, we\\'ve had a chat around your family to get understanding. You\\'ve updated me on what happens at night when you\\'re feeling paranoid. And we\\'ve started to see, visually, what the week looks like, and your-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --thoughts of to continue on with this next time. ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And that would, I guess-- we finish it off, and then we\\'ll be able to figure out days-- because Thursday, I know from after school I\\'ve got nothing on, and I guess I can push away the video games and that sort of stuff. I can do, like what they say at the school. A few hours every single day, it doesn\\'t hurt, but if you\\'re doing an assignment, and it\\'s due in a few weeks, at least do-- they say at least do two hours of homework. So an hour and a half or two hours, they said, of homework, so ### Human: And there\\'s some gaps around. ### Assistant: Yeah. And on a Monday, I can fit it between-- because normally Monday-- it\\'s the start of the week. I normally don\\'t do a lot of-- I don\\'t do homework, and when-- ### Human: Point being, you\\'ve really got some ideas. ### Assistant: --yeah. So I don\\'t do homework because it\\'s the start of the week. So I could easily go. We\\'d get home at that time. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: I probably could do homework from 5:30 till around about, maybe-- ### Human: Really stickily. ### Assistant: --because we have tea around about 6:30. So I could do 5:00 till 6:30, and then go again until maybe, 7:00-- ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: --because that leaves 5:30 till 7:00. That leaves, at least, enough time. ### Human: And that would be similar, then? ### Assistant: That would be the same time that we-- yeah, across the board, basically, unless it\\'s not possible. ### Human: Third week? Add in homework time, just so it\\'s a bit clearer. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: 5:30 to 6:30 PM. And then what was the 7:00? ### Assistant: The 7:00 was when I could finish. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: So 5:30 till 6:30-- so 6:30 is tea. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: And then what I do is, then I go back, and then do it from 6:30 till 7:00, so at least-- ### Human: How long are you going to eat tea for? ### Assistant: --not that long. It probably takes probably about-- maybe, around about 10 minutes, maybe. ### Human: Okay, and then another 20 minutes, yep. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: After tea. ### Assistant: Or I might start at 5:00. I don\\'t know. I\\'ll figure something out. ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: I\\'ll try that on a Thursday. ### Human: Try that? ### Assistant: And then I\\'ll see how that works. ### Human: So how much time-- was that for Monday and a Thursday or just a Thursday? ### Assistant: It\\'s probably only going to be for a Thursday, and then we can do homework over Saturday and Sunday-- ### Human: Yep. And then-- ### Assistant: --because, like I said, I probably couldn\\'t be bothered doing it on Monday. So I know it\\'s the start of the week, and I haven\\'t had to go to school on a Monday, but that doesn\\'t happen all the time. So yeah. Homework would always be on a Saturday and Sunday. That\\'s how I\\'ve always done it, even with assignments when I was in primary school and was still at high school. If I\\'d gotten homework, I-- well, and they didn\\'t give out homework at all, so. ### Human: You were saying it last time. So we\\'ve got the plan. Thursdays, and you\\'ll see what works for the weekend. ### Assistant: Yeah, depending on what happens. ### Human: And then next time we see, we\\'ll see how that\\'s gone. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: How\\'s that sound? ### Assistant: I can try it out on a Thursday, and I can do it on the Saturday and Sunday. And yeah. I\\'ll figure something out. ### Human: Sounds good. I\\'ll end this. ### Assistant: I think that is on. So there we are. ### Human: I think that is on. So there we are. ### Assistant: Sweet. ### Human: How you\\'ve been since last time? ### Assistant: Good. ### Human: Good? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: School holidays next week? ### Assistant: Coming up. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Done at the end of this week, and that\\'s it. We\\'ve got-- ### Human: Any plans? ### Assistant: I think Dad was planning to go away with us on his week. Otherwise, nothing much. ### Human: Nothing much? Yeah. And you\\'ve had the core thingy. What was that about? ### Assistant: Had that two weeks ago, I\\'m pretty sure, on a Friday. ### Human: The week we saw each other it was going to be the Friday, yeah? ### Assistant: It was Friday. I\\'m pretty sure. Yeah. It might have-- maybe, or--, yeah. It was a Tuesday. It might\\'ve been that Friday. Might have. ### Human: Yeah. some last week. Some Friday not too long ago. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: And how did that go? ### Assistant: It went well. Got to say what I wanted to say and, yeah, the main thing about it was to say what-- yeah, to say what you wanted to say. So, yeah, working out well. ### Human: And has anything changed with the arrangement or is that in the--? ### Assistant: The weeks that we have Mum and Dad where we\\'re going to get week on/week off so a week with Mum, a week with Dad. ### Human: Yeah. That\\'s what you were saying. Yeah. ### Assistant: That hasn\\'t happened yet, and I don\\'t know when that will happen though, but hopefully, soon. ### Human: Because that\\'s what you were saying. I was wanting to check is it week on/week off because at the moment it almost is but it\\'s a little bit like a midweek swap over and-- ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. It swaps over during the middle of week and then we go back and then we go back again, and then we go back. It\\'s all confusing. ### Human: Yeah. Because I remember-- ### Assistant: We\\'re going back and forth, back and forth. ### Human: --the first time that we met and we wrote it down, and it was, \"And in midweek, I change to Dad, and then I\\'m at Mum\\'s for a few days and then it swaps, and then--\" ### Assistant: Yeah. It\\'s confusing. But-- ### Human: Even trying to do this, just to get which day am I at Mum\\'s and Dad\\'s. ### Assistant: Yeah. Anyway, eventually, yeah, once we get week on/week off, it\\'ll be a lot easier-- ### Human: Yeah. Much easier. ### Assistant: --because we\\'ll make sure we know that we\\'ve got this week, what we can do there, and then we\\'ve got the other week, what we can do there. Sort of just that makes it a lot easier, I guess. ### Human: I agree, just so you know exactly it\\'s this and that day. ### Assistant: Yeah. See where I\\'m going ? back, and then we\\'re going to go back and then we go back again, and after a day, we switch back. Confusing. ### Human: And then if you have your stuff here and there, and at least week for week, you can-- ### Assistant: Yeah. And what do I bring to here and what do I bring there, like here? It gets really confusing a lot of the time. But, yeah, getting the week on/week off will make it a lot less confusing-- ### Human: Definitely, when you know. ### Assistant: --a lot easier as well. So, yeah, hopefully that-- I doubt it won\\'t, but hopefully, it does end up being that, and just that it makes your space a lot easier, just having to spend more time with Mum than Dad\\'s, but getting equal with each and having a week and so it\\'s sort of like you\\'re not jumping back between days constantly-- ### Human: And that\\'s-- ### Assistant: --and you\\'d have two days with Mum, then you have a day with Dad, then you go back and have to go back again, and it\\'s just confusing. ### Human: And that\\'s what you were wanting, a week on/week off? ### Assistant: Yeah, I think, but it\\'s easier, and I want that because it was going to make it easier, and we were speaking-- we\\'re speaking. We\\'re spending equal time with both Mum and Dad so, yeah, it just makes it a hell of a lot easier-- ### Human: Yeah. Makes it-- ### Assistant: --instead of this time and trouble just trying to work it out. So-- ### Human: Yep. Yeah. And you were, \"This day, that, and then we\\'ll get a second page for when it\\'s Dad\\'s.\" ### Assistant: At least now, --- ### Human: This\\'ll be easier to-- ### Assistant: When we get week on/week off, you just have that and then you have them other things which, yeah, just makes it a lot easier. ### Human: And you\\'re not sure when that\\'s coming about, the week on/week off? ### Assistant: Not sure yet. Might be next time we go to court, maybe. ### Human: And do you know when that is? If you don\\'t, that\\'s all good. ### Assistant: I\\'d be able to ask Dad. Dad might not know. I know Mum doesn\\'t, but Dad might know. That-- ### Human: We can always stick with how it is now and then swap it to a week about week then. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: And you saw it last week or the week before? When was it? ### Assistant: I think it was the week before. ### Human: Week before? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: And then she had the chat about now that you\\'re going into step two, did she mention? So we were doing step one before, which was the supportive problem-solving, and now we\\'re in step two. Is that making sense? You\\'re looking a bit blank. ### Assistant: Sort of. ### Human: Sort of. So the way the research study works is the first three sessions we have together, and that\\'s for the six weeks you\\'re in step one, then you meet with them and go into step two, and that\\'s either we continue with supportive problem-solving or we do cognitive behavioral therapy. Does that kind of ring a bell? ### Assistant: Yeah. That does sound to be-- ### Human: Yes? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ### Assistant: --oh, yeah. ### Human: So you\\'ve been assigned to cognitive behavioral therapy, which is CBT. So we\\'ll continue doing this kind of stuff, and what we\\'re looking at is how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors interact and how if you can change your thinking, that can change the way you feel and the way you behave. How\\'s that sound? ### Assistant: Sounds good. ### Human: Sounds good? Just wanted to give you an update so you\\'d know where things are at. So for the next-- I think it\\'s the next 12 weeks or so, and then we go into step three from there, depending on where you\\'re at. ### Assistant: It just sounded pretty-- good. Yeah. Just have to finish up the step one and step up. ### Human: Yeah. Like, \"What\\'s going on?\" So I\\'ll explain because you\\'ll be looking at me and go, \"Is this the same, what we\\'re usually doing or a bit different?\" because it might feel a little bit different, would be a bit more seamless. So I\\'ll probably be talking a bit more and double-checking things, where the supportive problem-solving was more what you were saying and more the listening and working together. But it\\'s still all collaborative and together, obviously. ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: What did you want to focus on today? ### Assistant: That\\'s the hard part. ### Human: I know. That\\'s the hardest part, asking that question. ### Assistant: Yeah, until the last time doing it. ### Human: Or I think have we spoken about what your goals are for coming in for counseling? Maybe we can look at that. ### Assistant: No, we haven\\'t done that yet, I don\\'t think. ### Human: I don\\'t think we\\'ve specifically done that. What would you like to work on? What would be important to you? ### Assistant:  ### Human: I\\'m going to write it down so we\\'ve got it as a reference. Managing time better, which is this stuff that we\\'ve already started doing, yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Anything else? And I ask so that we can keep each other on track. Are we keeping on track or have we gone off from what you wanted to be working on? ### Assistant: It\\'s a lot louder. ### Human: It\\'s loud, isn\\'t it? Yeah. I was thinking the exact same thing when it first happened. I\\'m like, \"That\\'s really loud today.\" ### Assistant: I\\'m thinking, but-- ### Human: Maybe the double couch drowns out the sound more. ### Assistant: Might be. I guess-- gee, this is hard. ### Human: And you can come up-- we can leave the page open. You can always add stuff. ### Assistant: Dealing with problems a bit better. ### Human: Any problems in particular? Just so I\\'ve got a better idea. ### Assistant: Things that Mum and Dad do that I may not like. ### Human: Is that going on at the moment or is that in general? ### Assistant: Well, it\\'s just in general, look at stuff. That\\'s all I can think of, to be honest. ### Human: My other thought - tell me if I\\'m wrong - is something around sleep. Is that-- ### Assistant: Yeah. Around sleeping. Yeah. ### Human: --what we spoke about? Yeah. How do you want to word that? Because that fits in with managing time also. ### Assistant: Yeah. I guess how ? when I just go to sleep, but-- ### Human: Is that improve sleep or-- ### Assistant: Yeah, I guess. ### Human: --- get to sleep, or? ### Assistant: Improving sleep, maybe. ### Human: Yeah. And then we can work on what, potentially, is going on around here also that we spoke about. What\\'s the priorities for you? And sorry about the messy writing. Or are they all equal and we just do a bit each time? ### Assistant: I guess probably the sleep would be a big one, then managing time. ### Human: Yeah. Have a go . two. ### Assistant: And then, yeah, dealing with problems, and I guess we can add from there as other things-- ### Human: Yeah. Definitely. ### Assistant: --pop up. ### Human: I can rewrite it and we can have it neatly written, and I can bring it in each time to check in are we on track. What would you like to start with today? ### Assistant: I guess improving sleep. ### Human: Yeah. So would it help to continue with that, to see what your schedule is to see where sleep fits? ### Assistant: Yeah, I guess. ### Human: Yeah? Because often that\\'s helpful to see where you\\'re tired, what goes on, and then we can focus on what goes on that you\\'re feeling paranoid before you go to sleep. Would that help, or would you rather talk about that first? Giving you too many choices today, aren\\'t I? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. I-- ### Human: Either/or? Shall we review this and see how it\\'s going and see-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --if this is changed, how things are with sleep? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: How\\'s the homework time been? Has that been realistic all week? ### Assistant: It has been realistic. I\\'ve done some stuff during it. Not a lot, but have been doing some. ### Human: Does that look accurate to what we had? ### Assistant: Yeah. Now-- ### Human: game change or is there an addition of any sport, sport meaning any football? Because I\\'ve got-- what it was last time, brought it in. Yeah. That\\'s what we had written down, was the rough schedule with the Thursday football League. Is that--? ### Assistant: That\\'s still not popping up yet. ### Human: Not happening yet, yeah? ### Assistant: We are having our football club games on Sunday now. We just had our first practice match a few days ago. ### Human: Let\\'s add that in. ### Assistant: I haven\\'t really had-- most games, they vary, but every Sunday I just go from-- ### Human: Yeah. What time was it, roughly? Sunday night, Sunday--? ### Assistant: Be around about anywhere during Sunday, I guess. ### Human: We can just-- ### Assistant: Because sometimes it varies on time. ### Human: Can even just put it down \"Sunday footie\" or whatever will be easy for you to read so it makes sense. Might pick a different room next time. What do you think? ### Assistant: Hmm. ### Human: It\\'s exceptionally loud today. And what time is it, roughly, or how long does it-- I think you said it goes for 90 minutes. ### Assistant: Yeah. I think. ### Human: Roughly. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. Probably around about 90 minutes. ### Human: Yeah. And it\\'s wherever in the day? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. It can go from 11:00 to-- it could go from 1:30, go full rounds at 2 o\\'clock. It just varies. I know now that we may yet do later games, maybe because we have no-- some days in 15s, we may get earlier games, we may get later games depending on-- so it\\'s just that area open for where we can have games. ### Human: Club football is under 15s or is it under 16s? You were saying last time there was a change. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. We\\'ve doing under 16s this year. ### Human: Under 16. Yeah. I\\'m just going to add it in, because I remember initially it was under 15s-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --but they didn\\'t have enough players, was that? ### Assistant: Yeah. The team folded and they were moved up to under 16s, and that\\'s come through so, yeah. ### Human: Good. You\\'ve still got that. ### Assistant: Yes. The under 16s age, which is good. ### Human: Great. And then again, are they still on a Tuesday? ### Assistant: Yeah. We\\'re having our last session today. ### Human: Ah. Because it\\'s Tuesday today, yes? ### Assistant: Yeah. So we\\'re having our last session and then that\\'s it until football season\\'s over. ### Human: Which is? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know when. I will check that next time. ### Human: Shall we rejig this and we\\'ll take out the key to what it\\'ll be? ### Assistant: Yeah. Because it\\'s that last session, but that would be-- we can keep this one for when it\\'s-- ### Human: On. Yeah. I\\'ll keep-- ### Assistant: --full season. ### Human: --that. ### Assistant: And we can easily do that one there. ### Human: And it was a fortnight you wanted to do? ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: Let\\'s do that. Would it be easiest to write down week one, week two, and you can put down which days you\\'re at Mum\\'s and Dad\\'s at the moment, or the way you did it, that you had Mum\\'s, Dad\\'s? ### Assistant: Well-- ### Human: It\\'s easy for you to read. That\\'s the goal. ### Assistant: Or I might say so it\\'ll a bit-- ### Human: Yeah. Come closer. ### Assistant: --easier. ### Human: I\\'ll see if there\\'s another-- ### Assistant: We can do. ### Human: And there\\'s blue also, if you want to mix up the colors. ### Assistant: We can use the blue. ### Human: That\\'s right. It starts from Monday, not Sunday. I was just looking at that, going, \"You\\'re not at school on a Sunday.\" ### Assistant: I just did school across the board. This\\'ll be a Friday. ### Human: Do you have school on a Saturday? ### Assistant: No. I don\\'t. Yeah. ### Human: That\\'s exactly what I meant. It just continued on. ### Assistant: I was just kind of school, school, school, school, school, school, school. ### Human: You can add it on to that one too, and I\\'ve got a spare page just in case. ### Assistant: This\\'ll make it easier if we write it all down and move it around. Not write on Saturday. ### Human: Unless you do go to school on a Saturday. Some people do. ### Assistant: Some people do. I made the assumption do sport on a Saturday. ### Human: Oh, do they? So there\\'s school sports-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --on a Saturday? ### Assistant: Lucky, the County doesn\\'t do that. That would be hard. ### Human: Wouldn\\'t like that? ### Assistant: No. I wouldn\\'t be bothered going to back to school just to do sport. I wouldn\\'t be that dedicated doing it. ### Human: So your hockey may not have been happening if-- ### Assistant: If it was a Saturday. I\\'ll put that down.  So that\\'s school. ### Human: Because it\\'s a Wednesday, is it, hockey? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. It\\'s Wednesday. ### Assistant: this is it\\'s Wednesday. ### Human: So that\\'s school we\\'ve got. ### Assistant: So I don\\'t have to write when I wake up, because it\\'s not on there. ### Human: Up to you how much detail or how simple you\\'d like it to be. ### Assistant: We can go 6:00 because that\\'s when I wake up to go to school, and then we can just do-- ### Human: So you\\'re up at 6:00? ### Assistant: --9:00, and that\\'s where I get to around about 8:00 at school. ### Human: Yeah. If you can write even on one, \"Wake up 6:00 AM,\" and we know it\\'s across the board. Tiny writing to fit it in. ### Assistant: And-- ### Human: Just write 8:00 AM next to school. ### Assistant: --2:00. I think we\\'ll get there in the end. About time. ### Human: 8:24? I like the specific time. ### Assistant: Yeah. Right. So we can do-- ### Human: And when do you finish? I think that\\'s what we had down here. ### Assistant: 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 1:00 to 2:00. I finish at 3:20. ### Human: And do you finish 3:20 every day? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. I\\'d check because in my school, we used to finish one day at 3 o\\'clock. I don\\'t know why, but one day of the week it was 3 o\\'clock. ### Assistant: That\\'s not bad. So we\\'re going to do school, and don\\'t know how to make this look neat-ish with just-- that can just be all school. ### Human: Yeah. You can do that. Yeah. ### Assistant: Because that\\'s neat-ish. ### Human: Was this not neat-ish for you? ### Assistant: Looking at it now, it\\'s like all confusing with the arrows and the-- ### Human: Yeah. We want to make it so it\\'s easy to read. So if you wanted to put it up on your wall, you could see it straight away. ### Assistant: Yeah. And we can make Tuesday-- ### Human: So we had the plan-- ### Assistant: Yeah. And we mentioned it. ### Human: --of homework was on a Thursday. Was that working? ### Assistant: We could also make it Tuesday. Yeah. That was working. Not after taking off. I couldn\\'t be bothered. ### Human: So-- ### Assistant: So on this one, we can sort of make it that I do it till 6:30, and then I do-- on Sat/Sun, and then do some Tuesday, maybe? Monday or Tuesday. ### Human: Yeah. We\\'re trying to be realistic of how much will you actually do. And if we hypothetical were to put it five hours each night, would you actually do that? Probably not. ### Assistant: Probably about two or three hours maybe. ### Human: Busy, yeah? ### Assistant: I wouldn\\'t really do that much. Just keep writing-- ### Human: Using example that you\\'d be like, \"Yeah. Probably not.\" ### Assistant: And like you go, \"Yeah. I wouldn\\'t do five hours.\" But, yeah, I\\'d do five hours and end up doing three a week. ### Human: Let\\'s make it realistic because we can always chop and change and add to it. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. yeah. ### Human: It\\'s not a black-and-white. ### Assistant: There. ### Human: Great. ### Assistant: All right. And-- ### Human: Do you want to copy it onto here? Or do you want to continue on with that one? ### Assistant: Keep on this one then maybe I\\'ll move on to doing that one. All right. So-- ### Human: And if you need to change colors or any other ones, I\\'ve got some-- yeah. There\\'s-- ### Assistant: : a pen for that. ### Human: Over there. And there\\'s nothing. ### Assistant: There\\'s-- ### Human: And there\\'s a whole box of-- ### Assistant: --crayons-- ### Human: --pencils here also. ### Assistant: All right. We can go orange and pink. Orange is Dad\\'s. Can just mark it-- ### Human: I like it. ### Assistant: There we are. ### Human: That\\'s it. ### Assistant: Bam. All right. So-- ### Human: And pink is Mum\\'s, yeah. ### Assistant: Dad and-- ### Human: Yeah. ### Assistant: And so over at-- I should make that call. ### Human: Looking good. ### Assistant: So-- ### Human: Can you just scribble anywhere? Just use the end of that. ### Assistant: We can do Mum\\'s on Monday, also on Tuesday. Wednesday at Dad\\'s, Thursday at Mum\\'s. Friday at Mum\\'s. And then Dad\\'s in. So it\\'s Dad\\'s Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. ### Human: Yeah. And this is week one. ### Assistant: And we can go week two. Monday, Tuesday, and then Mum\\'s all the way through again. ### Human: Yeah. Because it\\'s almost-- ### Assistant: Get this right p. ### Human: --50/50, but it\\'s a little bit-- ### Assistant: Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. So it\\'s sort of like-- ### Human: --different. Yeah. ### Assistant: --we\\'ve got more Dad\\'s than Mum, then we are Dad. So then this\\'ll all change again and we\\'ll have to totally rewrite it. Doesn\\'t matter. ### Human: Yes, that\\'s right. Yeah. ### Assistant: All right. So we can now-- ### Human: This reads really nicely. ### Assistant: Looks a lot better, there. ### Human: Yeah. And then what might help you also to know which week is where am I. ### Assistant: All right. So 3:20 finish, then we can do-- ### Human: So realistically, what days of the week work best for homework? ### Assistant: Probably either Saturday or during the week, like maybe because Tuesdays are coming, and we can do Tuesdays. ### Human: Yeah. Has Thursdays worked, or have you done it on a different day? ### Assistant: Thursdays-- ### Human: I\\'m just looking at what we had. ### Assistant: --have been working, and only do the 5:30 till 6:30. Probably, we can-- ### Human: Yeah. Well, we put us 5:30 and 6:30. Let\\'s make it so it\\'ll work, and if the 6:30 to 7:00 didn\\'t happen, let\\'s just cut it out. ### Assistant: Oh, we can get when I get home which is about 4:00, 4:30. No, we don\\'t really get home about that time. Probably about 4:50, I\\'m going to get home, so maybe we can start it from 5 o\\'clock till 6:30. ### Human: We can do that. ### Assistant: That might work a bit better. ### Human: Which days, though? ### Assistant: Anyway-- oh, so 3:20 finish. ### Human: Because initially, you said leisure time was on a Monday. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Is that staying or do you think homework would work on a Monday? ### Assistant: I think we\\'ll just keep it as leisure, so we can-- ### Human: We want it realistic. Yeah. ### Assistant: Like I go to bed-- I go around about-- bed. So make it bed. ### Human: Looks like it was leisure. ### Assistant: : around about 4:00, 4:50, I got home. ### Human: And is that the same for Mum and Dad? They\\'re at the same time or different? ### Assistant: I\\'ll get home a bit-- because the bus drops a bit closer to Dad\\'s house, so we normally-- I\\'m not sure what time I get dropped off at home, so I will leave Dad\\'s drop-off time because, yeah, we do get dropped off a bit earlier. So we might go home at about 4:20, maybe. I\\'m not sure. I\\'ll just keep 4:50. ### Human: Yeah. It can be a similar time for-- ### Assistant: But, yeah. my finish at school is the same. We may get home around about 4:30. Maybe I\\'m at home somewhere. ### Human: So we\\'re just giving it an extra little bit of time to-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Just in case you miss that bus or it\\'s delayed or whatnot. ### Assistant: I know. I\\'ll just put 4:30 because I think we get home around about that time. 4:30. And then 4:30. All right. So this-- still on the bus. ### Human: All right. Wavy lines are the bus. ### Assistant: Yeah. All right. Then 5:00 to 6:00, so we can do-- ### Human: I thought you were going to write tea at 3:30 there when you had the feeling, like, \"Oh, we\\'ve backtracked.\" ### Assistant: Tea at-- ### Human: And that fits in for the days you have-- and also, that tea\\'s at 6:30? ### Assistant: Dad, I think we can do-- ### Human: Oh, that\\'s Dad. Yeah. ### Assistant: --tea. Now you mention it, tea I don\\'t actually have on the 6:30 on a Wednesday. ### Human: That\\'s all right. We can change-- ### Assistant: I think it\\'s around about-- ### Human: Because you\\'re 5:00 to 6:30, but then you said it was-- ### Assistant: 8:00-ish. ### Human: Yes. Because training\\'s till 6:30. ### Assistant: I think it might be at 8:00. So tea --- ### Human: Hop it one down. Yeah. ### Assistant: --8 o\\'clock, maybe 8:10 is tea. ### Human: Friday\\'s also club football. ### Assistant: 8:10-ish. Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. That\\'s for tea. Yeah. ### Assistant: And-- ### Human: And where are we fitting in homework before you color it all in? ### Assistant: So Tuesdays, 6:30 after tea. ### Human: Yeah. Do you want to maybe pop it in blue? Would that help so it stands out over the line? ### Assistant: Thursday we do-- this is training. ### Human: And that\\'s training. ### Assistant: Training, train, and we can do-- ### Human: Did I give you a pen that doesn\\'t work? That fits. ### Assistant: Homework. ### Human: That was-- ### Assistant: 5:00 till 6:30. And then we can do-- ### Human: And then if anything changes with the schedule, we can always fix it up. ### Assistant: Bang. And then-- ### Human: Yeah. Sunday, we\\'ve got Sunday Club League at some point in the day. And is there a minimum expectation of how many hours of homework you do in a week? ### Assistant: About two or three people around about. So I need to color footie and-- ### Human: Just checking we\\'re on track with everything too. Green? Yeah. What gets to be-- ### Assistant: We can do-- ### Human: --green? ### Assistant: Basically the whole day, we don\\'t have-- that\\'s footie around about 5:00. We don\\'t normally go past there. ### Human: Yeah. So somewhere in that time, just depending on when the game is-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --yeah? ### Assistant: There we are. And we can do that as footie. ### Human: Yeah. Did you want to add the training in there too as green or just the actual games? ### Assistant: We can do training as well. ### Human: --- ### Assistant: That\\'d be-- ### Human: Because that\\'ll be helpful when it changes for us to, say, copy that and widen it out and see where it fits in. So that\\'s week one-- or was that week two, or? ### Assistant: Yeah. This will be week one. ### Human: And then-- ### Assistant: And that is it. And-- oops. ### Human: Woo. That\\'s pretty much it. ### Assistant: Yeah. That\\'s it. And we still got the colors. All right. So-- ### Human: Yes. You\\'ve done a good job putting it in. ### Assistant: --school. ### Human: So they\\'re all 3:20, and then, yeah, just figuring out Mum and Dad. ### Assistant:  ### Human: Dad\\'s is--? ### Assistant: 4:30. ### Human: Because Dad\\'s a little bit closer, yeah? ### Assistant: And then at 4:50. Yep. And we\\'ll do this as school. Yeah. ### Human: And the other color was bus. Yeah. ### Assistant: All right. And tea at Dad\\'s-- ### Human: These two days have got two-- ### Assistant: --we have no idea. ### Human: So there\\'s not a specific time usually? ### Assistant: Not at Dad\\'s. I think it\\'s around about 7:00, maybe. ### Human: Yeah. Pop it-- ### Assistant:  ### Human: Okay. Wednesday. ### Assistant: Wednesday, we\\'ve got football training, and it\\'d be about-- so that\\'s with Mum, maybe around about-- ### Human: Yeah. It\\'s a little bit further? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep. And then Mum\\'s-- ### Assistant: And that\\'s all we can do. wait till 4:30, home. There we are. And then we can do-- then tea again, so good. ### Human: Makes it easier. ### Assistant:  ### Human: You\\'re at Mum\\'s. ### Assistant: 6:30, tea, and then, yeah-- ### Human: Bedtime at Dad\\'s similar? ### Assistant: Yeah. Around about. Sometimes it\\'s a bit later, but I try to get down there, try to go to bed at the same time. just a bit too how can I spend that time now. ### Human: Yeah. We can always change things up and see. ### Assistant: I\\'ll just put it back down, but-- ### Human: min. ### Assistant: --it doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s the same way around. ### Human: We know what you meant. ### Assistant: So all right. ### Human: Are we missing anything? ### Assistant:  ### Human: And is Saturday a homework-as-needed kind of a day? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: And Sunday? Yeah. ### Assistant: Tuesday, not so much at Dad\\'s because I don\\'t have all the stuff there. ### Human: Yeah. So it\\'s not really going to happen at Dad\\'s? ### Assistant: Yeah. No. Not at Dad\\'s. ### Human: So that\\'s more of a Mum-- ### Assistant: And then Saturday, we can do it around about when? Till about 3:00, maybe. ### Human: From like 12:00 to 3:00-- ### Assistant: Do-- ### Human: --depending on how much. ### Assistant: 12 o\\'clock. the any of that works. ### Human: Yeah. Three and a half hours that you can chop and change. So I\\'m hearing homework\\'s more realistic at Mum\\'s-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --to do? And when you\\'re at Mum\\'s, it\\'ll be weekdays. And this week it\\'ll be-- how do you think it\\'ll look when it\\'s one week on Mum, one week on Dad? Or is that for us to follow up on when we get there? ### Assistant: Let\\'s follow up when we get on with that chapter, and make sure I\\'ve got stuff for Dad\\'s, I guess. ### Human: So you can chat about what we can do to help you remember--- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --to do that? ### Assistant: But that looks around about what was going on. ### Human: And how do you feel around this to help with managing your time? ### Assistant: What I might do-- ### Human: There\\'s a body in there. ### Assistant: What color is it? ### Human: What color is--? ### Assistant: I can do gray just any other time, I guess. Makes it a bit easier for me to see it. Yeah. ### Human: And that\\'s the point. ### Assistant: That\\'s just-- ### Human: So it\\'s as easy as possible for you to read it. ### Assistant: Yeah. And that\\'s just-- ### Human: And has it been helpful-- ### Assistant: --all the spare time. ### Human: --putting it down on paper? ### Assistant: Yeah. Makes it a lot easier to look at. That\\'s spare time there, and this is spare time except for tea. Put tea. We should put-- ### Human: Up to you if you want to pop it in there or if it\\'s a bit more relaxed on the weekend. ### Assistant: It would be a bit more relaxed, I guess. Free time here. That\\'s about right. ### Human: That looks about right? ### Assistant: And we can do this as-- ### Human: I like how school is free time.  Ah, clever. ### Assistant: Free time at school. There we are. And we can do it on this as well. Yeah. This is sort of pulled back a bit more so it\\'s joined up with two. Yeah. it joined up with two. I guess that\\'s free time. ### Human: And you\\'re essentially meaning flipping that the other way? ### Assistant: Yeah. it doesn\\'t matter. ### Human: Doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s all good. We know what you mean by it. ### Assistant: And am I-- yeah. That\\'s one, two, three. ### Human: Are we adding three days of homework one week? ### Assistant: In ones, and one, two, three. That\\'s it. 10 o\\'clock, bed, and then we\\'ll do it. And we can do-- ### Human: And does that really stick? You\\'ll do it three times a week that week? ### Assistant: At Dad\\'s I can do homework on a Saturday and that\\'s easier. ### Human: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. ### Assistant: We can do that from-- yeah. I\\'ll spend from 12 o\\'clock, 3:30. And then 10 o\\'clock, bed. That looks exactly the same. And then free time at school. There we are. ### Human: That looks pretty good. ### Assistant: It\\'s easy to read, and your free time is the times I have off. ### Human: How many copies would be helpful for you to have of this? ### Assistant: Probably two copies so we can keep these here and we can have four, so two of each. ### Human: Yep. Because I was just thinking-- ### Assistant: So one at Dad\\'s; one at Mum\\'s. ### Human: Because I was just thinking, \"I\\'ll copy you one,\" and went, \"No, that\\'s not going to work if you\\'re at Dad\\'s and this is at Mum\\'s.\" ### Assistant: Yes. Yes. And then we\\'ll do two copies and I can just put it up on the wall or put it in my wardrobe at Dad\\'s on the front of it. I\\'ve got Blu Tack that I can put on it, so. ### Human: Great. And we can review it next time to see is this working? Do we need to change anything? ### Assistant: That looks a lot neater than that one there, instead of just-- ### Human: And that-- ### Assistant: --writing it all down. It looks a lot neater. ### Human: And sometimes you need to trial it out to go, roughly, what will it look like and to put it down. ### Assistant: Yeah. Looks pretty good, though. ### Human: Okay. Realistic? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah? ### Assistant: This one looks a bit messy, but it doesn\\'t matter. That was just playing around a bit. ### Human: Yeah. Figuring out the times and stuff. ### Assistant: Yeah. Looks pretty good. ### Human: Good. And we\\'ve got a little bit of time, so maybe we can start on talking a little bit about sleep, and maybe do you think we\\'ll check in on that and maybe focus more on sleep next time? Does that sound--? ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. ### Human: Because you\\'re going to bed-- we\\'ve got the back of what we did last time. You\\'re going to bed at 9:30 but you\\'re not really asleep until-- ### Assistant: Around --- ### Human: --1 o\\'clock? ### Assistant: --or 1:00, yeah. Sometimes go to bed at around about 11:00 and depending on how much I\\'ve done in the day because I do do a lot of exercising on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. ### Human: So you more do-- ### Assistant: And Friday, I do-- that is at Dad\\'s, so I do sport at school, and I\\'m good at that one-- ### Human: You get that? ### Assistant: --for long. ### Human: Yeah. So-- ### Assistant: And then Wednesday, I\\'m doing sport at school. ### Human: So Wednesday\\'s sport at school. ### Assistant: And Tuesday as well. ### Human: Just good to know what\\'s at school. Yeah. ### Assistant: And Thursday and Friday. Thursday, I\\'m doing sport at school. And Wednesday and Friday as well. Yeah. Wednesday, I\\'m doing sport and also football training, and then Friday\\'s just doing football training. ### Human: And for these days, is your sleep different with getting to sleep depending on if you\\'ve done sport or not? ### Assistant: Yeah. Mondays, sometimes I even go to bed at 1:00. Some days, if I\\'ve done enough-- ### Human: Yes. And is that because it\\'s hard to get to sleep? ### Assistant: Yeah. And if I\\'ve done enough running on a Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday, I may go to bed at around about 11:00 or 12:00. ### Human: Because you say you go to bed 9:30, does that mean you fall asleep? Is that what you\\'re meaning? ### Assistant: No. That\\'s when Mum sends us to bed. So Mum sends us to bed at around about 9:30. ### Human: And what do you--? ### Assistant: 10 o\\'clock\\'s when Dad sends us to bed. And I sort of get to bed around about the same time on the weekday and weekend. ### Human: So it\\'s about 10:00 PM, between 10:00 to 11:00? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep. And that\\'s because you\\'re lying in bed for the hour? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: You\\'ve gone to bed, you\\'re in bed, but you can\\'t fall asleep? ### Assistant: Yeah. I try to go to sleep but I just can\\'t. ### Human: So when you\\'ve exercised more, it\\'s easier to fall asleep? ### Assistant: Yeah. Because I\\'m a lot more tired. Yeah. It depends if I\\'ve done a lot of running. ### Human: Yeah. So your energy levels are impacted then on what-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --goes on too, yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Which makes sense because often when you exercise, you\\'re more tired and it sounds like it\\'s easier. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: And do you feel less paranoid when you\\'re more tired, that it\\'s easy to fall asleep? ### Assistant: I still get-- ### Human: --- ### Assistant: --paranoid. But I guess how long I can physically keep myself awake is a lot less when I\\'ve exercised and done stuff during school. ### Human: Okay. And how about Saturdays and Sundays? ### Assistant: Saturdays and Sundays, Dad sends us to bed at around about-- well, Mum sends us to bed and Dad said that they want us around about 10 o\\'clock to go to bed. But at Dad\\'s, might be going to bed at around about maybe 1:00 in the morning on a weekend. Obviously, that\\'s not possible because we\\'ve got games, so depending on that, that means that we\\'re going to have to go to bed a lot earlier. But at the moment, Dad says that TV in the lounge room has to be turned down a lot because their bedro ### Human: Yep. And I\\'ve brought this in to remember the-- ### Assistant: --so-- yeah. So the-- ### Human: --setup. ### Assistant: Yeah. So the main lounge room gets turned off-- well, it doesn\\'t get turned off. It gets turned down at around about 10:00 or 9:00, on volume, and Dad only comes out if we\\'re awake at-- if we\\'re awake till 3:00, he comes out and turns it off and tells us to go to bed. But that rarely happens. Normally, we fall asleep at around about 1:00. At Mum\\'s, Mum sends us to bed at around about 10:00, and I go to bed at around about 11:00 or 12:00 on a weekend. ### Human: hours. So that\\'s Dad\\'s, and mother\\'s 10:00. And you\\'re asleep 1:00, was that, or 11:00? At Mum\\'s 10:00 PM\\'s bedtime, and what time are you asleep usually? ### Assistant: Normally around about 11:00 or 12:00. ### Human: 11:00 to 12:00. 12:00 PM. Yep. ### Assistant: Yeah. And that\\'s around about . yeah, on Dad\\'s, though. So we fall asleep at around about 1:00-ish. So-- ### Human: So that\\'s roughly, in my very nice neat writing,  is what it looks like at the moment. ### Assistant: Yeah. That\\'s how it looks like, yeah. ### Human: So it\\'d be helpful to focus on what goes on that it can take you an extra hour and a bit to fall asleep, for next time. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: How\\'s that sound? And if you want to have a think of any examples for us to problem-solve together with dealing with problems better. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah? ### Assistant: But otherwise, it\\'s a pretty productive. I usually like-- ### Human: It does look pretty productive. ### Assistant: --a lot of colors. ### Human: Colors are good. I\\'m a big fan of colors because you can see it easier. ### Assistant: Yeah. It makes it a lot easier. Normally, I don\\'t color-code, but sometimes I do, depending on-- ### Human: Some things are just easier color-coded, to get your head around. I\\'ll put this one back so we\\'ve got it for next time. Good job. ### Assistant: Looks pretty good. ### Human: Anything else you wanted-- ### Assistant: : for later. ### Human: --to do today, or you think we\\'ve done a good job? ### Assistant: Nothing else, really. I really wanted to focus on getting this a bit more organized and a bit neater. ### Human: Yeah. Which we\\'ve definitely done, I feel. ### Assistant: Yeah. And I can have that both at Mum and Dad\\'s, and I can tell Dad what I\\'m doing and-- ### Human: So they both know. ### Assistant: --I\\'ll know he\\'ll support it. He\\'s big on school because-- yeah, he\\'s big on school because he knows that I don\\'t like going to school and that I don\\'t like doing-- ### Human: Homework and stuff. ### Assistant: --homework and just don\\'t like doing maths, all that sort of stuff. I only do it if it was sport-related, which is most of my stuff at the moment. ### Human: So that\\'s really positive that there\\'s a lot that is sport-related? ### Assistant: Yeah. Because I\\'ve got Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday during school, yeah, where I\\'ve got my school things, my school sessions on, and I get homework for them, and I always do it because it\\'s-- a sport and I just love-- I like to do it and-- ### Human: So it\\'s what you enjoy, which-- ### Assistant: --and things like-- ### Human: --makes sense-- ### Assistant: Yeah. Like on a Monday or a Tuesday or a Wednesday, all the way, every single day at school I have sums. Once a day I just go, \"No, I can\\'t be bothered doing it.\" So, yeah, I\\'ve just got to figure them out and then, yeah, I just need to do them. And if Dad knows the times that I\\'m doing homework then, yeah, Monday and Tuesday are now when I\\'m going to be able to get that done because Dad gets home late and it\\'s a bit too hard. So, yeah, it just means that I have to do it that w ### Human: We\\'ll try it out. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: So next time I\\'ll see you, it\\'ll be school holidays. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah? We\\'ll check if she has a next appointment booked in and we\\'ll go from there. ### Assistant: so we might have-- I\\'m not sure. Mum, probably-- depending on went the next one is. So either-- because so I think this is how it-- ### Human: Where are you at-- where were you at this week? ### Assistant: So this is week-- we\\'re on week one now. ### Human: Week one, yeah. ### Assistant: So this is week one. This is what it is at the moment. So at Mum\\'s today, and tomorrow, we go Dad\\'s after school, then we go back. So what happens is Friday, Saturday, Sunday, normally Dad would have us for Monday and Tuesday, but instead of doing that, because it\\'s the first week of school holidays Mum has us for that week and then Dad has us for the second week. So week one-- ### Human: It\\'s kind of-- ### Assistant: --is the second week. And week two is-- so, basically, Mum. So after this, on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday it\\'s at this time, then Mum has us and then Dad has us the other week Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and we go back to school Wednesday because we\\'re a private school. So instead of going-- ### Human: Ah, so you\\'ve got a few days, yeah? ### Assistant: So instead of going back on Tuesday, I think next term we go back-- so this term, next term, we start back on a Wednesday. The next term after that, we start back on a Tuesday. So they alternate. We get one day more, so the public school goes back on a Tuesday and we go back on the Wednesday, which is good because it means we get an extra day. So Dad has us Monday, Tuesday. ### Human: Does Dad take you here also, or is it Mum that\\'s been taking you? ### Assistant: Mum\\'s been taking us here every single session. Dad has taken us a few times. He knows how important this is because Mum and Dad both decided together for us to do this. ### Human: And how are you finding it? ### Assistant: It\\'s all right. Yeah. It\\'s helpful. I wouldn\\'t have done any of this if it was just me. I wouldn\\'t gone, \"Pfft.\" Just ignored it. ### Human: Which it can be easier to ignore when you\\'re feeling stressed if you\\'re less stressed, but then the stress can increase because you\\'re not-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --planning things which can make it easier sometimes. So if there\\'s anything else that\\'s really stressing you, we can do something like this or whatnot. ### Assistant: Yeah. So that\\'s what\\'s happening. We go back to Mum\\'s on the Tuesday at around about the end of school time, so around about 4:00-ish. So when Mum-- no. That\\'s what time we\\'d get there. So Mum would probably come pick us up around about then on the Tuesday, and then we go back to school on the Wednesday morning. ### Human: Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. Shall we--? ### Assistant: Wait. Or do we get to Wednesday off? ### Human: Is the Tuesday--? ### Assistant: No. Ah, I get it. So term one is we\\'d normally go back to school on the 30th or 31st. Term two, we go back on the Tuesday. Term three, we go back on the Wednesday, and then term four, we go back on the Tuesday again. So it\\'s only term three that we go back on the Wednesday. No. We go back on the-- this could-- ### Human: Because when you go back to school, isn\\'t that the weekends, that day? back to the Tuesday? ### Assistant: --- ### Human: And that\\'s probably why you start on Wednesday this term. ### Assistant: I know that we do get a Wednesday off and we go back on a Thursday. I can\\'t remember-- ### Human: When. ### Assistant: That might be term three, but every other day, we go back on the Tuesday. ### Human: Tuesday. Yeah. ### Assistant: Every other term. I know that one term, we go back on the Wednesday. I know one term. ### Human: You\\'ll keep me posted when you-- ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: --find out? Shall we check and see-- I\\'ll turn this off. ### Assistant: Okay. ### Human: Okay. ### Assistant: Cool. ### Human: All gone. So it\\'s Mom\\'s this week. ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: Yep. And then Dad\\'s next week. ### Assistant: And then Dad\\'s next week. So we just came back from Dad\\'s on the Monday after-- ### Human: From school. ### Assistant: Yeah. Monday afternoon. ### Human: I think using this is going to help me figure out which week we\\'re on. ### Assistant: Yeah. So we are on-- ### Human: So I brought it in so we can-- ### Assistant: So we just come off-- ### Human: Wednesday. Is that--? ### Assistant: Because it\\'s-- ### Human: Or is it a bit different? ### Assistant: Because it\\'s holidays, we have a week with Dad, well, around about. It\\'s not a straight week with Mom, a straight week with Dad. But I think we came off-- ### Human: It was-- ### Assistant: No. We came off Dad\\'s week. So Dad had us from the Friday after school. ### Human: Because this was week one last week when we saw each other. ### Assistant: Yeah. So-- ### Human: We were on here, yep. ### Assistant: Yeah. We had Dad on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday afternoon, and then we went back to Mom\\'s for Tuesday and Wednesday. Today\\'s Thursday, isn\\'t it? ### Human: Yes. Yep. ### Assistant: Yeah, it is. So Thursday. So we go back to Dad\\'s-- I think it is-- I think it works out to be that-- Mom\\'s, Mom\\'s, Mom\\'s, Mom\\'s, Mom\\'s, Mom\\'s. Then we had Dad\\'s. Yeah. So we have Mom till Monday, till Monday afternoon. So then it goes back up to here. So it\\'s sort of acting like what happened. ### Human: So week, week, yeah. ### Assistant: So we go back Monday right about 4:00 like we did last time. And then we have Dad all the way till Sunday and also Monday and Tuesday. ### Human: And then you\\'re going on a camp soon, Mom was telling me. ### Assistant: And we\\'re going on a camp for three days for our mission trip which is coming up. ### Human: What kind of trip? Emission? What\\'s that? ### Assistant: So the mission trip is-- what\\'s that? Vanuatu. So we go to-- ### Human: Oh, awesome. ### Assistant: --Vanuatu for-- I think it\\'s two weeks, I think we go for. Around about there. ### Human: Is that with Mom you\\'re going to Vanuatu? ### Assistant: This is at school. ### Human: Yep. At school, yep. ### Assistant: So we go with-- so we have groups. So there\\'s two mission groups. ### Human: Oh, mission. I thought you said immersion, and I was like, \"What\\'s immersion?\" Mission groups. Gotcha. Yes. Yep. ### Assistant: Yeah. So there\\'s two mission groups, and they go into two different places. So I can\\'t remember the other one, but our group\\'s going to Vanuatu. and we plan, we teach, and all that sort of stuff for a few weeks. And then we come back. Yeah. Then we come back to school. So I think it\\'s around about two weeks, I\\'m pretty sure we go for. So we teach the kids there sport. We go do some looking around lifestyle and that sort of stuff. But yeah. Everyone has to teach at least a class. ### Human: Yep. And how old are the kids? ### Assistant: Well, we were doing from Prep all the way to Year 4, I\\'m pretty sure. Because the teachers also take a class. So the teachers were taking Year 5s, and we had 4s, 3s, 2s, and 1s, and Preps to choose from. So me and the person that I\\'m working with are doing Year 2s. ### Human: Yep. Year 2s. ### Assistant: So what happens is there\\'s-- so there\\'s one group, and we\\'ve split them up into two little groups. So there\\'s two groups in the mission group, which confusing there\\'s so many groups. But so one person does a certain year level. So one group would do Prep to 4, and the other group would also do Prep to 4. But they do them different days, I\\'m pretty sure. So we\\'ll be teaching, let\\'s say, the Year 2s, or we might cut off-- there might be a certain day or a time during the day where the other ### Human: Yep. So maths and English, yep. ### Assistant: We have to teach some-- we have to teach some sort of sport. There was something else, but I know-- yeah. But we had to-- ### Human: That\\'s all right. There\\'s something else. ### Assistant: We had to teach maths in English because that\\'s one of their big things. They teach them maths in English over there, and they also do their spelling normally in-- yeah. They normally do their normal spelling and all that sort of stuff. ### Human: Yep. And does everyone in a year level do this? The mission? ### Assistant: Well, you don\\'t have to. The idea of this was that you\\'d put in a thing and whoever wanted to do mission would go do it. And the people that didn\\'t want to go do mission had to do work experience during that time. So while we\\'re on mission, the rest of the year level that didn\\'t want to go to mission have to do work experience for that time that we\\'re there. So basically, the whole Year 10 level is gone. So there\\'s no Year 10s at school. All of them are working. ### Human: And when is it that the mission-- do you know the dates when you\\'re on it? ### Assistant: I think Mom does. I don\\'t know them yet. We haven\\'t explained the dates that we go yet. ### Human: Because I\\'ve booked in an appointment when Mom\\'s away, and Mom probably was sure that you\\'re not away then. ### Assistant: Yeah. 100%. ### Human: I\\'ll plop-- ### Assistant: I hope that-- ### Human: Because-- ### Assistant: Yeah. I hope that that week-- ### Human: I\\'ll plop it on a card in case we finish up before Mom does, and she can call if there\\'s any issues, because your grandparents were going to take you in on a Friday afternoon in a few weeks. ### Assistant: In a few weeks. ### Human: Did Mom talk to you about that or not just yet because it\\'s a bit in the future? ### Assistant: Mom hasn\\'t said anything about that as I know that we\\'re with Dad for the second week until Tuesday. So unless Mom\\'s talking about that Friday or the Friday in Dad\\'s week, I\\'m not sure. I have to speak to Mom about that now. ### Human: All good. We\\'ll follow it up. I\\'ll write the date on a card. And when I spoke to Mom, she said that\\'d be fine and your grandparents would be able to take you on. ### Assistant: Yeah. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s-- ### Human: Take you over there. ### Assistant: --week back to school. ### Human: And then, yep, that should-- ### Assistant: Yeah. Oh, it can\\'t be, because we\\'ve got the three-day trip, unless we go back on the Tuesday. ### Human: Last time we were discussing what day you do get back. ### Assistant: Yeah. I don\\'t know that yet. ### Human: And I realize, looking back now, I\\'ve been a week ahead of myself when I think Anzac Day is in two weeks, and each time it\\'s like a month away. But you probably go back on Tuesday because of Easter Monday. ### Assistant: Yeah. Probably. That\\'s probably what happens. ### Human: And that\\'s a three-day thing that you have on. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. We have the three days. If Mom\\'s organized not to get me here when we\\'re not doing mission trip, we might actually-- ### Human: When is--? ### Assistant: --go back to school on the Tuesday. ### Human: When is mission trip start? ### Assistant: The mission camp? ### Human: Yep. When is that? ### Assistant: The mission camp starts first day back at school from the holidays. ### Human: This term, yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. So , we\\'ll come back. We\\'ll come back from holidays. And we will go straight into mission for the three days, and then we come back. So it\\'s sort of like a mini camp. It\\'s a mini mission camp, so it\\'s practice. ### Human: Oh, and the Vanuatu-- when\\'s that? Because I think I\\'ve confused my understanding. So that\\'s the three days. That\\'s what Mom was talking about, the three days. ### Assistant: Yeah. The mini camp is the-- ### Human: That\\'s the mini camp, yep. ### Assistant: --three-day camp which goes, probably, from Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. ### Human: Yep. That\\'s what Mom was talking about. ### Assistant: The mission trip, we\\'ve spoken about the dates. I don\\'t exactly remember. I know it\\'s pretty far in. ### Human: So I was understanding that that was the one you\\'re going away for two weeks. ### Assistant: Yeah. Because-- ### Human: So it\\'s the mini camp you\\'re going on now. ### Assistant: Yeah. Because Dad\\'s girlfriend, sarah, is having. ### Human: Step 2, session 6, 2011. Continue. ### Assistant: So yeah, it\\'s been good. ### Human: Tell me some more about you. ### Assistant: A little bit happier. Well-- ### Human: You look a lot happier than last time too. ### Assistant: I am a little happier. Especially the four weeks made different-- ### Human: What did this-- ### Assistant: Well, made new friends. School\\'s out right now. What we were both heading to is the fact that we didn\\'t have a lot of friends at school and sort of looking at going back. ### Human: And we started having a lot of discussions around what a friend means to you. What\\'s changed? Because you were saying you can\\'t-- from memory, you can\\'t really trust the people at school, or they weren\\'t really interested in sports like you were? ### Assistant: Yeah. Just weren\\'t interested in stuff that I was interested in. I found a friend that I do have some things that interest. I tried , and sort of stuff, feel the same. ### Human: That was important to you. Someone who jokes around. ### Assistant: Yeah. There\\'s still some people that sort of, they are not, but otherwise, I just sort of trust them, but not a lot. ### Human: Yeah. So you\\'re cautious, but you know you can talk to them about some things, yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. Still keeping that contact with other friends from me as well, which is a good start. ### Human: So where are things at with school at the moment? ### Assistant: Well, I was in trouble because mum and dad saw-- well, we went and saw a family psychiatrist or something like that. ### Human: Yep. Counselor, psychologist, or so, yep. ### Assistant: And we ended up talking about what they could do to help us and lots of stuff, and we did that. And also, thinking about the best plan for how long we spend at Mum\\'s and how long we spend at Dad\\'s, so that went through as well. And we put in half and half, so it would be one week with Mum and one week with Dad. ### Human: Yep. Which is what you were wanting? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep, 50/50. ### Assistant: Until our birthday where we could figure out-- because at 16, the courts say that if we were to get our-- so we\\'ve got the 50/50, but we don\\'t want to do it anymore, and Mum wants to take that to court and it doesn\\'t exactly get looked at because they think it\\'s a waste of time because we\\'re old enough to make decisions like that, so unless how we\\'re feeling, we can sort of flip between houses whenever we want. I think that\\'s one thing though. I have to really speak with Dad abou ### Human: No, you can take it off if you like, keep it on if you want. ### Assistant: Feeling just talking to you, it\\'s sort of like a-- ### Human: At that level. ### Assistant: So yeah, I have to speak about Dad about that. He\\'s got a bit more understanding than I do, and he and I-- ### Human: When does that come into play? ### Assistant: I have no idea. I know that Dad and Mum had it just them, having a conversation with him about it. They went back after we\\'d gone because it was just us four and then it was just Mum and Dad that wanted to come back-- wanted Mum and Dad to come back and speak about that, so I wasn\\'t-- it comes into play. I think, again, I have to speak to Dad, Dad\\'s got a bit more understanding. Mum doesn\\'t like to speak about that stuff because she reckons it\\'s just between her and Dad, but it invo ### Human: And you said you and I? I interrupted you. You were about to say something. ### Assistant: Oh, and you and I are on the exact same page. ### Human: Great. ### Assistant: In fact, whatever we do, we decided it\\'d be us two figuring it out, so it wasn\\'t really what I wanted to do and what i wanted to do, we sort of found out stuff. And at the moment, what you and I want to do is sort of the exact same thing. ### Human: And what is you both want to do? ### Assistant: Well, we both want to have half and half and in January we were going to speak with Dad, mum and I, and then end up speaking to Mum about it, just us four about it and figuring out what we can do, so whether or not we spend more time with Dad or we want to keep the half and half if it works out well. Then we can go on from there or we wanted to spend all the time with Dad and spend a weekend with Mum, which is what was originally-- but we\\'d only see Dad for a weekend. So that\\'s what w ### Human: Yep. What do you think that\\'s about that she doesn\\'t take the-- ### Assistant: The fact that we don\\'t want to be around her as much. That\\'s the thing she finds hard to understand. ### Human: And what\\'s that about for you that you don\\'t want to be-- refresh my memory from-- ### Assistant: Ah, she\\'s just-- she doesn\\'t really hide her emotions very well, so if something happened, nothing to do with us, she\\'d come home crappy, and that sort of made it hard for us because we\\'d get home and she\\'d get home, and we\\'d be up on the computer or something, we\\'d be on our phones, that sort of thing, and she\\'d immediately come home and start getting us to do stuff. As soon as she walked through the door, there\\'d always be something wrong in what we were doing or what we\\'d had done or we h ### Human: What not done. Yep. ### Assistant: Yeah. And yeah, it was just sort of that side of things were hard and the fact that she-- I don\\'t know if she\\'s getting better or she\\'s trying to, but she really likes to not hint that she\\'s taking it-- because what angry she gets or take it out somewhere else, the fact she\\'s hinting to take it out at Dad, but not really saying it. Because she says, \"I\\'ll take it out on someone else that deserves it,\" or that sort of stuff. ### Human: You get angry at Mum when she says take it out on someone-- does she? ### Assistant: Yeah, I get angry at Mum and she says, \"Go save it for somewhere else,\" or \"Go take it out on someone else.\" That sort of thing. The fact that she\\'s hinting towards Dad-- well, that\\'s my understanding, like she\\'s aiming at that, might not be. And the fact that she doesn\\'t accept the fact that when we\\'re angry at her, we\\'re angry at her. She doesn\\'t believe that we\\'re angry at her, so that sort of thing, it\\'s sort of hard to take. And we sort of spoke to the psychiatrist guy that Mum and Dad ### Human: That\\'s great you were able to say that. Because that would\\'ve been really hard to go, \"Hey, this is where I\\'m feeling,\" so that Mum knows where you\\'re at so you can find that middle ground. ### Assistant: Yeah. And again, she didn\\'t take it very well. ### Human: What do you mean by that, she didn\\'t take it very well? ### Assistant: The fact that we don\\'t want to be with her because she\\'s hard to live with, the fact that she\\'s constantly barking orders at us, and the fact that we\\'re angry at her. She doesn\\'t like to believe that we are. She sort of saw that as the fact that she\\'s not doing any of that, which is what she normally does. So it\\'s sort of what was going on. I think it was after we got back. ### Human: And when did you get back? Last-- ### Assistant: We got back from Vanuatu Sunday last week. ### Human: Sunday last week, yep. ### Assistant: And we got back from Thailand weeks ago. Back on a Saturday. Yeah, about three weeks ago. Three weeks ago we got back from Thailand, we had a week of school, and then we went and had-- and got back. Which is what I thought it was, which was we had a week of school and then we had Vanuatu thing with the school, sorry. ### Human: Yep, that\\'s what you said it was going to be was three weeks, a week-- ### Assistant: It\\'s going to be a week of school, and then we go-- ### Human: And then school holidays, yep. ### Assistant: And then we\\'d go and then we\\'d be-- the first week of school holidays would be in-- yeah, would be in our-- yeah, we\\'d be in Vanuatu the first week of school holidays, and then we\\'d come back and we\\'d have another week of school holidays and two days. ### Human: Yep. So you\\'re not at school today? ### Assistant: No. ### Human: Oh, you still got it off? ### Assistant: Yeah, we\\'ve had-- we go back to school Wednesday starting third term. ### Human: And you were telling me, I remember, the last time going, \"It\\'s two days and I started Wednesday one term, that you started a Tuesday another term,\" and weren\\'t sure which term it was. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Hence, why you\\'re not in your sports uniform today. ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah, because I would be in sports uniform today. Yeah, so that\\'s what-- yeah, so we go back to school tomorrow. So we had Monday off as well, which is good. ### Human: How\\'re you feeling about going back? ### Assistant: I\\'m sort of a bit happier. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Still sort of half and half, but yeah, a lot happier of the fact to get back into the swing of things and get back into school. ### Human: Yeah. And are you okay with that at the moment? ### Assistant: Yeah, at the moment. Sort of half and half. Still looking at going back, but yeah, sort of happy to be there at the moment. At least for the fact that you know. If the friends that I have, our religion side of things, we don\\'t have to-- ### Human: You\\'re not too keen on the religion? ### Assistant: No. That we don\\'t have to do it and we weren\\'t going to move until the end of the year anyways, and we don\\'t have to do it for year 11 and 12, and it\\'s only up to year 10, so that sort of is also-- I did better as well. ### Human: What is it about the religion thing that you don\\'t like? ### Assistant: I don\\'t believe in God and that sort of stuff, so it\\'s a bit uncomfortable because of the fact that it\\'s so-- that\\'s them as a school, so. ### Human: That would be different to the way it would work. ### Assistant: Yeah. So that was good to find out the fact that I don\\'t have to do it for year 11 and 12, which is good, so. ### Human: That changed your way of thinking a bit too? ### Assistant: Yeah. Whether or not I wanted to stay at the school or that sort of thing. ### Human: So you\\'re 50/50 at the moment, but it\\'s okay. ### Assistant: It\\'s okay to be here at the moment I think. ### Human: Yep. That\\'s good to hear because last time it was really tricky and you were really not liking school because of the friendships. It sounds like meeting someone new that you click with more has made it a bit more comfortable at the school. ### Assistant: Yeah, yeah. And a few other people that I would never thought of even talking to. ### Human: What made you choose-- what happened that you started talking to them? ### Assistant: Because it\\'s the sort of thing that you\\'re just talking to them for two weeks and you\\'re in groups with them. ### Human: Aw, so this was from Vanuatu? ### Assistant: Yeah. So I found that easier. ### Human: Yep. So it sounds like going to Vanuatu\\'s had a big impact? ### Assistant: Yeah. I thought I would be sitting there alone, speak to no one, and that one person that I really knew and a few other people that I\\'d spoken to a few times. Yeah, it was only us four boys and the rest were girls, and we split into 11 kids, so. ### Human: Is that four boys, including me? ### Assistant: No, we were split up into groups. ### Human: You were split up, yep. ### Assistant: So there was four boys and there was 11, so there was six girls, 11 kids. So 22 kids, and then they split them up, I think. So yeah, the majority of them were girls. There were hardly any boys, but it didn\\'t really matter and you sort of found-- yeah, other people to talk to that were all right, so that was good. ### Human: That\\'s good to hear. And what would you like to focus on in counseling? We had a few goals from last time when we spoke, but I was wondering if anything\\'s changed or if it\\'s similar stuff you want to work on? ### Assistant: Not really. Not really anything\\'s changed. ### Human: Do you want me to spark your memory of what we had written down as the goals? Would that help? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: We had you wanted to improve your sleep, manage your time better, and dealing with problems better, in particular, communicating with Mum. Are they still similar, or something you think is going okay that\\'s not really a goal anymore? I don\\'t-- ### Assistant: Improving sleep, don\\'t need to focus on at the moment. I\\'m really tired from being away for so long. Going back on planes, so I\\'ve been getting to sleep a bit easier. ### Human: Right. Sleep\\'s easier. You said that when you\\'re physically tired, you sleep better? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: I had, I think-- we had written down that one-- the back of that on a different one, but you\\'re saying-- are you still seeing the blurs? Is that still happening? ### Assistant: Yeah. I\\'ve been normally getting to sleep at around about 11:00, 12:00 now. ### Human: 11:00, 12:00. And has it been hard to fall asleep, or you\\'re able to? ### Assistant: I\\'m able to because I sort of sit down on bed and I can\\'t keep my eyes open. I just sort of relax a bit and then that\\'s it. ### Human: What\\'s that that you relax a bit, because that\\'s something you previously said has been really hard to relax. What-- ### Assistant: If I\\'m really tired, I can\\'t keep my eyes open, I\\'ll just close my eyes and I sort of just start to drift off and that\\'s it. That\\'s when I\\'ve been doing for the past-- that\\'s been happening for the past three nights. ### Human: Have you seen the blur or heard any sounds? Or do you feel you fall asleep and that hasn\\'t-- ### Assistant: I haven\\'t really heard any sounds because it\\'s cold, the sounds don\\'t really happen as much. ### Human: What do you think that\\'s about. It\\'s cold, the sounds don\\'t happen as much. ### Assistant: Because when it\\'s hot, Mum keeps the windows open. And there\\'s little wooden beads on the end of it because our blinds, we pull them down, and they\\'ve got little things and they pull them closed. So you don\\'t need to close them. They\\'re little canvas things-- canvas blinds, and when you shut them, they got little wooden beads on the end. When the window\\'s open, they crash in and on to the skirting around the windows. So now because they\\'re all closed, I don\\'t hear the noises much. The fridge ### Human: How often is that? ### Assistant: The fridge normally turns off at the same time because the temperature gets to the point and it just shuts off. ### Human: So it sort of shuts off, and-- ### Assistant: That sort of depends-- it stops working as hard to get the fridge cool. I don\\'t know, it doesn\\'t happen at certain times, it happens-- ### Human: Just when it happens. ### Assistant: Yeah, when it\\'s-- ### Human: And is that every night that scares you or every few nights, or? ### Assistant: Mostly happens every night. Sort of keeps me awake because you hear that voice. So it\\'s sort of turning off the elements-- the other elements, so that scares me a bit. ### Human: So that\\'s most nights, it sounds like, but you said that it hasn\\'t-- has that not been impacting on you the last week or so? You said you\\'ve been really tired. ### Assistant: Hasn\\'t been impacting me in the last week, but that\\'s just been one of the normal sounds that I hear. I got someone who banged on the door handle to know if people are coming into his room, which sometimes that can, I guess, basically like-- because it\\'s ceramic, hits against the wooden door. Makes like a ting and that wakes me sometimes. ### Human: And then how do you go falling asleep after you hear the sound and wake up? Because you\\'ve said it can be really hard to go back to sleep, but you said you\\'ve been sleeping-- ### Assistant: I sleep the same before I did with traveling, before I was traveling. It hasn\\'t really changed. It\\'s still hard to go back to sleep. ### Human: How many times do you wake up, do you feel, from hearing something? Obviously you don\\'t keep track in your sleep and count. ### Assistant: I don\\'t really keep track of how many times. Probably about three or four I hear a noise or something like that. ### Human: And that\\'s been the same as before holidays? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Roughly, yeah. ### Assistant: Even before Thailand. Thailand was really easy because you\\'re doing so much and Vanuatu\\'s easy because we were doing so much. Actually, Vanuatu, not as much, but I still finding it hard to go to sleep there. But because we were constantly doing stuff over in Thailand, swimming in the pool, that sort of thing, I did genuinely get tired, so. ### Human: And did you hear sounds or see a blur when you were in Thailand or Vanuatu? ### Assistant: Sort of when the lights turned off and stuff a little bit because I didn\\'t know-- I don\\'t know the room, so the light when people come in, that sort of thing. If anyone was to come in, there\\'s a balcony that was pretty easy to get through, that sort of thing, so I don\\'t really know what-- but yeah, still found it and there was a dividing door between Dad and mom\\'s room. I believe mom and I, us three, and then it was Dad and me in the other room. So that was a bit-- yeah ### Human: So you had some thoughts of what if someone comes in? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Did you think someone actually would, or was it more of what if? ### Assistant: It was sort of like if someone would. ### Human: Yep. If someone, what would I do? Kind of like protecting yourself, yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. Different country and it was the same in Vanuatu. ### Human: Yep. So that\\'s wanting to feel safe. Yep? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: And have you been at Mum\\'s or Dad\\'s the last two weeks? ### Assistant: In the past two weeks, I\\'ve been at Dad\\'s for a few days and Mum\\'s. I\\'m still at Mum\\'s. ### Human: And the sounds-- ### Assistant: Going back into the normal routine. ### Human: Yep. So is back into this one? ### Assistant: Same one, yeah. ### Human: Exact same one? I still have-- ### Assistant: I\\'m not staying Thursday and then we go back to Dad\\'s Wednesday and we go to Mum\\'s Thursday and then we go back to Dad\\'s Friday, Saturday, Sunday. ### Human: Yep, that\\'s it. ### Assistant: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is Mum\\'s. ### Human: Stayed exactly the same? i had a different day potentially. ### Assistant: That should be. Yeah, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, back at Dad\\'s Thursday, at Mum\\'s Friday, Dad\\'s Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and then next Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. ### Human: Yep. I think you started with this week, that\\'s why I was confused looking at this one. Got it. ### Assistant: Yes, we\\'re with Mum Monday, Tuesday. ### Human: And are the sounds at Mum\\'s and Dad\\'s? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep. And the blur, was that at Mum\\'s or Dad\\'s, or that has been happening-- ### Assistant: That\\'s both at Mum and Dad\\'s. ### Human: And it\\'s still a crack in the door, or is it different, the blur? ### Assistant: I close the door at Dad\\'s now. I can\\'t close my door at Mum\\'s. ### Human: What\\'s that about that you can\\'t close it Mum\\'s. ### Assistant: Hangs the towel on the door. ### Human: Physically can\\'t close it, yep. ### Assistant: Yeah, so I push it hard as I can and I can\\'t see anything through it, but my room\\'s still light enough to unplug my nightlight and it\\'s still light enough to-- ### Human: What\\'s that because that\\'s changed, because you used to have the nightlight-- what\\'s changed that you unplug it? ### Assistant: Just the fact that because when I first had the nightlight on, it was sort of like, \"Aw, it\\'s all right, I can\\'t be able to see,\" but then I started seeing stuff because it was too bright. It started seeing shadows inside my room thinking that someone was there, but then I wake up, I think I see something at the door and it\\'s not. not bright enough to see, and now I\\'ve unplugged the nightlight, it\\'s a lot darker. ### Human: So was that helpful? ### Assistant: So I guess I can\\'t see anything now, so I\\'m a bit more worried, but I can\\'t see because it was light enough that I could see something that-- stay awake because I thought I\\'d see someone, making me awake again and making it harder for me to sleep, and so yeah, that was sort of like a-- so that was the problem that I had with that, but now-- so the fact I can\\'t-- sorry. ### Human: No, you\\'re all right. ### Assistant: The fact that I can\\'t see in, so if I was to see a shadow, it wouldn\\'t-- it wouldn\\'t like scare me a bit, so that\\'s why I unplug the nightlight, and-- ### Human: Because that would decrease you feeling scared because it\\'s too dark to see anything. ### Assistant: Yeah. I think that someone\\'s there, but if I can\\'t see the shadow, it doesn\\'t make me-- because I don\\'t think someone-- because when I saw the shadow, I think someone\\'s there and that makes me awake again. ### Human: So by keeping it dark, you don\\'t see a shadow that used to worry you, \"What if someone\\'s there?\" ### Assistant: And that\\'s what the problem was, and then I put the nightlight on and it seems like-- was a rock for ages, and then sort of started moving into light and I could start seeing things, even with the light on. Yeah, start seeing shadows. ### Human: Because the light was there to help with seeing the shadow initially, wasn\\'t it? Yep. ### Assistant: Yeah, so I didn\\'t see any shadows and I had the thing and the fact could someone be there. But now it\\'s sort of like, \"Yeah, I can see the shadows, I\\'m seeing things,\" so it was a bit hard, so I unplugged it. ### Human: When did you unplug it? ### Assistant: Before I left for Thailand. A few weeks before that. ### Human: Yep. And you\\'re finding-- because you say it\\'s easy to get to sleep, so you don\\'t see a blur or anything or hear anything else? ### Assistant: Not at the moment because I\\'m so tired and I still am physically drained from being sick. ### Human: And are you hearing any sounds at the moment? Say in the last week? ### Assistant: I still am, but sort of not-- so tired it\\'s sort of not-- it\\'s like, \"Yeah, I can hear it.\" So like that. I still have problems because I have to go the toilet. ### Human: Yeah. How do you go, needing to the go to the toilet in the middle of the night? ### Assistant: I sort of hold on and then go to sleep, but I do wake up because I have an infection in my ankle coming back from Vanuatu. ### Human: How\\'d that happen? ### Assistant: I ended up falling through a hole in concrete and got a little scrape and it was fine until the Sunday morning when I came back and it\\'s going through. I\\'ve had antibiotics. It doesn\\'t hurt to walk on it anymore, so I\\'ve been drinking a lot of water because it\\'s been taking a lot out of me, and that\\'s adding-- ### Human: So that would add on into-- ### Assistant: And I needed to really go and I\\'m like, \"I can\\'t hold it or I\\'m going to piss myself in bed,\" so I had to get up and I went into the thing and I put it on lock and it was sort of looking back, and-- ### Human: Was this in Vanuatu or home? ### Assistant: No, it was just as home. And yeah, so I got-- went to bend and then-- so I went to the toilet and then I opened the door with the light on and then quickly turned it off and then ran. And again, leaving the door open. This was like 7:00 o\\'clock in the morning, still pretty dark, and-- actually, it was probably about 6:00 in the morning or something like that. Even earlier then that because I know this is the time I had to wake up to go to hospital to get X-rays and bloods done and that sor ### Human: That makes sense you\\'d go to work to get that done. ### Assistant: Yeah. So I don\\'t know when-- ### Human: That would have been? ### Assistant: Yeah, it was probably around 5:00 o\\'clock because it was still really dark and I heard a creaking noise, so I still didn\\'t go to sleep. Was my point really. So I\\'ve got to wake up anyway, so I stayed awake and I started hearing the creaking of the toilet door because I didn\\'t close it properly. ### Human: And where do you think that comes from that you have that-- you freak out with, \"Is someone in the house?\" ### Assistant: I have no idea. ### Human: Because you spoke a while ago saying that hearing sounds-- because you used to hear Mum and Dad arguing maybe. ### Assistant: Yeah, sort of frightened me, that sort of stuff. Yeah, it could be. I don\\'t know. I really don\\'t know what the thing is. ### Human: And you\\'ve never been broken in to or someone you know that\\'s been broken into the house before? ### Assistant: People that you know have been broken into, I think, while they were sleeping or something, either in a room or someone else. ### Human: How old were you then? ### Assistant: This was not long ago, to be honest. Before that, I had no idea. ### Human: And that was happening before? ### Assistant: I didn\\'t know anyone who had been broken into. ### Human: Just wondering if it maybe happened and that\\'s where that piece come from, and it might not be. ### Assistant: I reckon it\\'s from the video games I play. ### Human: What do you think? ### Assistant: I know that video games don\\'t do it. ### Human: That\\'s Mum\\'s hypothesis. ### Assistant: I sort of know video games do and they\\'re not real. The fact of someone being there, or-- yeah. I don\\'t know where it comes from. ### Human: What do you worry about with someone being there? ### Assistant: Just someone being there watching and being in the house when-- and that sort of thing. It\\'s a bit weird. ### Human: And why do you think someone would be in the house? ### Assistant: No idea. Just something that exactly doesn\\'t feel right. ### Human: Like you go, \"What if?\" Do you feel someone would be in the house? Is there a greater chance they would or wouldn\\'t be? ### Assistant: So like the fact that they could be, but they\\'re sort of not. ### Human: Yep. You know that there\\'s a greater chance there wouldn\\'t be someone, but you really can focus on the what if someone is here. ### Assistant: Yeah. It hasn\\'t happened, but it\\'s just sort of a thing that could be. ### Human: And then you lay the plan to put in a lot of place to keep safe with the nightlight, turning it on, having the door closed, yep? ### Assistant: Yeah, make sure windows shut, that sort of thing. Curtains closed. There\\'s no one at the window, if there was. Keeping doors around me shut so there\\'s no way getting in around me. Yeah, that sort of thing. ### Human: And how would you like your sleep to look? How would you like things to look like? ### Assistant: Just sit down to bed and go straight away. ### Human: Strange question, yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah, so just for me to hop in bed and go to sleep straight away. That\\'s something. ### Human: Yep. And that\\'s been happening the last week. Is that what\\'d you say? ### Assistant: It\\'s been happening the last few days. ### Human: Last few days, yep. ### Assistant: Yeah, because I\\'ve been so tired. ### Human: But then, when you\\'re not as tired, which you said if you don\\'t play as much sport, then it\\'s not? ### Assistant: Yeah. If I\\'m not physically tired, it\\'s a lot harder to fall asleep because I\\'m still awake-ish. ### Human: And have you thought-- we have it down here, if you hear a sound, you say to yourself, \"It\\'s nothing.\" Has that helped, or have you tried that, or not really? ### Assistant: Part of me, I sort of try to get up and see what it is, but certainly it\\'s kind of the door, that sort of thing. ### Human: Does that help? ### Assistant: And trying to do that sort of does, but it\\'s whether or not I can get myself to do it and get out of bed to do it because normally I freeze in bed and I sort of go, \"It\\'s nothing. Go away.\" And I\\'ve been trying to get up to make sure that I know that, \"Yes, there\\'s no one there, there\\'s nothing happening,\" that sort of thing, so. ### Human: So you\\'re kind of double checking. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Is that helpful doing that? ### Assistant: Hasn\\'t happened-- I sort of can\\'t get the courage to get out of bed to look at it. I have a few times, just gone to the door, peeked through, opened it a bit and looked through, and then ran straight back into bed, but nothing-- it hasn\\'t really helped at all. ### Human: Does that make you feel more stressed? ### Assistant: Sort of the fact that yeah, sort of know that they\\'re not there around me, but it\\'s whether I can even work up the courage to even go to the door and even walk out to even check, yeah. ### Human: And do you feel that would be helpful if you were doing that every night? Would that make sleep harder, do you think? ### Assistant: Oh, that can make sleep a bit easier because I know that no one\\'s there. Sort of trick myself into that, \"There\\'s no one there, so there\\'s really no need to bother,\" that sort of thing. ### Human: Tricking yourself? ### Assistant: Yeah, I guess. ### Human: What\\'s another word we can use? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. ### Human: I don\\'t think you\\'re tricking yourself. ### Assistant: I\\'m really not, I\\'m just making sure that no one\\'s there. ### Human: Yeah. So you\\'re kind of challenging the way you\\'re thinking? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. Doesn\\'t sound like you\\'re trying to trick you brain, it sounds like you\\'re trying to tell your brain it\\'s okay. Is that something you think you could try, or is there something else we can think of? ### Assistant: No, I\\'d just give it a shot. ### Human: Yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. Like I said, I\\'ve tried to do it a few times, but it\\'s been with the courage to get out of bed. ### Human: So what would stop you from getting out of bed? ### Assistant: The noises or the fact that someone could be, so there\\'s no need to get out of bed, just stay in bed. ### Human: So you\\'re safer if you\\'re in bed? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yep. So does that really mean you would get up and check then? ### Assistant: Yes. Sort of like the fact that there\\'s no need to get out of bed because you hear a noise, you\\'re all right, but if you stay in bed, it might go away or nothing will happen, that sort of thing. ### Human: So would you rather stay in bed or get up? And what I\\'m doing here is problem solving with you to go-- ### Assistant: Getting up would help for me to go, \"Yeah, there\\'s no one there, so there\\'s no need to worry,\" and that sort of thing. ### Human: Yep. So is that something you think you could try for maybe a few days and see if that changes? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah? How many days do you think you could try it, say from today and the next time I see you? ### Assistant: I guess try as much as I can. ### Human: Yep. How often is that? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. ### Human: If you make the goal more specific, it\\'s more achievable. And really stick. ### Assistant: I don\\'t know, two to three times. ### Human: Two to three times, yep. Any particular day do you think could be more realistic? ### Assistant: Try at least every day maybe. ### Human: Yep. You said two, three-- ### Assistant: Two or three days. ### Human: Yep. So you\\'re going to try two to three times. At a particular day you will try? Or is more likely one day than another? It\\'s lot to think about, isn\\'t it? ### Assistant: Yeah. I don\\'t know, actually. ### Human: Or is it we try you being in bed and being able to calm yourself, that\\'s next steps, or? Totally your choice. How about if you\\'re more comfortable going to sleep, and then when, if you wake up, you feel more comfortable going back to sleep. ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know specific day. I have no idea. ### Human: Is it days that you play-- are you playing footie at the moment? So you\\'ve got your ankle-- ### Assistant: I didn\\'t play last Sunday, but I will be all right Wednesday. ### Human: For tomorrow? Yep. ### Assistant: And hopefully Sunday. ### Human: Yep. So the infection\\'s all good? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: That\\'s good to hear. ### Assistant: A bit painful around the sore, it\\'s cold and I can run in football boots, that sort of thing. ### Human: Yeah. And do you have a plaster or something over? ### Assistant: No, it\\'s just a Band-Aid over it. ### Human: Yep. So what could help with sleep? Doing something that\\'s not too hard, but you can challenge yourself a little bit to see if that could change sleep? ### Assistant: Just going out to check that. That\\'s the only thing I could think of. ### Human: But you also say that-- ### Assistant: If I hear a sound. ### Human: You\\'re also saying that could be really hard to do, to build up the courage to double check. It\\'s not easy to do a plan. ### Assistant: No, it\\'s not. ### Human: I can see you\\'re deep in thought going, \"What will work?\" Because you\\'ve said you\\'ve been trying and you do it most nights to say, \"It\\'s nothing,\" but that doesn\\'t really calm you, does it? ### Assistant: Yeah. It doesn\\'t. ### Human: Anything else you could either say to yourself or do, do you think? ### Assistant: Just turn my back to the door and try to fall asleep again. ### Human: Have you tried that before? ### Assistant: No. I always try to think of things. ### Human: Yeah. Let\\'s write all the things you\\'ve thought of down. So there was turn back to door, get up and check, courage to do, maybe-- any other ideas? ### Assistant: Not really. ### Human: You can try, I\\'m wondering. If we write these 1 to 10 of how difficult it is to do, how hard is it to say to yourself, \"It\\'s nothing.\" From 1 to 10? ### Assistant: Not really hard. ### Human: Pardon? Not hard. So how would you write it with 10 being really easy, 1 being really, really hard. ### Assistant: 10. ### Human: 10, yep. That\\'s 10 out of 10. ### Assistant: Just basically just saying, \"It\\'s nothing. Don\\'t worry about. Just go back to sleep.\" ### Human: \"Don\\'t worry about it. Go back to sleep.\" And turning your back to the door, getting up and check, what\\'s easier to do? ### Assistant: Turning my back to the door. ### Human: Out of 10, how hard is it? Or how easy is it to do? ### Assistant: 10. ### Human: 10, yep. 10 out of 10. So that\\'s the easiest, and then that. And if you turn your back to the door and you\\'re still feeling stressed, what could you do? ### Assistant: I guess go out and check. ### Human: Yep. How hard is that out of 10. ### Assistant: About 4 or 5. ### Human: 4 or 5, yeah. 4 or 5 out of 10. Could that be an idea, you start with saying it to yourself, turning your back, and then seeing how you go with getting up? ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: And we can wait to see how hard it was to do? Does that really stick? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Anything else you\\'d want to add or change, or you go, \"No, that\\'s not going to work.\" ### Assistant: Nothing. ### Human: So we can do like a bit of an experiment to see which of these work, and if something helps more than another, we can add a few things. We\\'ve kind of created the easiest thing to do and then the hardest because you say you do that already and it\\'s really easy to do, but you can still get caught up with, \"Is someone in the house?\" ### Assistant: Yep. It\\'s nothing that I\\'d change. ### Human: Is that helpful, doing that? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Writing it down. Do you want me to re-write it so you\\'ve got a copy, or you think you\\'ve got it? ### Assistant: I think I\\'ll be all right. ### Human: Yep. So what are the three things you\\'ll do? ### Assistant: Say to myself, \"It\\'s nothing. Don\\'t worry. Just go back to sleep,\" try to get back to sleep. If not, turn my back, and if still not, see if I can get up to check. ### Human: Yeah. And we can check in and see how often you did the three and what was helpful, what wasn\\'t, and replan it next time. How\\'s that sound? ### Assistant: Good. ### Human: Good? Have you been using this before? Do we need to redo this, or is it about the same, or is there anything? ### Assistant: I don\\'t think we will redo it until the half and half comes in. ### Human: Yep. It\\'s staying the same for now. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: And footie\\'s still the same days? ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: Yep. I was wondering if it had changed. ### Assistant: It\\'s coming up to the end of football though, but. ### Human: And do you play another sport in summer? ### Assistant: No. ### Human: Why did I think you played cricket in summer? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. ### Human: I just decided that you do. ### Assistant: No, I don\\'t play cricket at all. I just play football. ### Human: I don\\'t think you\\'ve ever told me that you, but some reason, I thought you played cricket. I don\\'t know why.  Maybe it\\'s just my association, football\\'s in winter and cricket\\'s in summer. It doesn\\'t mean that you\\'d be playing it. ### Assistant: No, I only do football. There\\'s not really a different sport that I do. ### Human: Did you do some hockey at school. In your last term maybe? ### Assistant: No. I did that in the summer. ### Human: But not really a thing you do? ### Assistant: No, that\\'s only for school. Something just for school. ### Human: Yep, that\\'s what you were saying. Maybe I\\'ve got hockey and cricket confused and they\\'re very different sports. And how have putting in the homework-- because you were saying that was tricky and I know you\\'ve been on holidays for a while. ### Assistant: Yeah. I really haven\\'t had any homework for the past few days. ### Human: You wouldn\\'t have, you\\'ve been on holidays, yeah. ### Assistant: But when I get back to school, I got to start getting back into the swing of things, yeah. ### Human: And where we had it, does that look like it\\'d be the same, or is it more-- you\\'re just going to wait and see? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know what it looks like. This looks like what I do, yeah. ### Human: Well, we can have a relook at that next time. Does that sound good? And do a bit of the plan with sleep? ### Assistant: Mm-hmm. ### Human: Anything else you wanted to chat about today? ### Assistant: Not really. ### Human: I think we\\'ve covered it pretty well. And have you got a session with Mum coming up with this? Mum spoke with you about that? Whilst you stare at me blankly. ### Assistant: No, I don\\'t-- no idea about that. ### Human: Okay. So Mum had booked in a family session for you and me with her in a few weeks. ### Assistant: I hope not. ### Human: Mum hasn\\'t spoken to you about that yet? ### Assistant: No. ### Human: What are your thoughts around-- ### Assistant: I don\\'t really know. I don\\'t really know much about-- it might be good, it might not, I\\'m not 100% sure. ### Human: From my understanding, when I chatted to Mum, a space for all of you to be able to talk to each other so you can communicate better because like you were just saying that Mum gets angry and doesn\\'t talk to you. ### Assistant: Yeah, but I guess the sort of thing is, no matter who she\\'s around or what we deal with, she\\'s still not going to-- that\\'s just her-- she doesn\\'t take that sort of stuff. And I kind of did something with dad with Mum and he felt the fact that Mum was still getting angry and stuff, but not showing it around. Yeah, I guess give it a go, but don\\'t really know what\\'s going to happen, but yeah. ### Human: Like you\\'re saying, it\\'s good to give it a go because something could change, and good for you to bring up, \"Hey, this is how I felt it was in--\" ### Assistant: She might choke on that, that\\'s just what he told me because he did it with her, so. ### Human: And remember we were chatting, see how you go with that, but I\\'m happy to have a session with you and Mum in the future, if you\\'d like that. We\\'ve spoken about that and we plan that together. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Totally your choice. But we planned it so that Mum didn\\'t feel-- hopefully wouldn\\'t feel that she\\'s feeling blamed and we\\'re trying to work it through together. How you feeling? ### Assistant: Good. ### Human: Good. Good. Because I saw your face like, \"What is she talking about.\" ### Assistant: I have no idea about that, no. ### Human: Maybe Mum had left until it\\'s closer to the date to have a chat about it. ### Assistant: I wish she might not have told us and just brought us anyways, yeah. ### Human: Has that happened before? ### Assistant: Yeah, she has done that before, yeah, so. ### Human: Well, I\\'ve definitely given you a heads up because Mum had said she would be chatting to you to check that\\'s something you\\'re interested in, and you can definitely bring it up with Mum and go, \"Hey, I was following up that you were still having that session.\" ### Assistant: Yes. Yes, she has done that a few times where she doesn\\'t tell us and then just brought us, so. Could be anything. ### Human: That was definitely happening. It definitely would have been discussed with Mum, is the plan, and probably she would\\'ve been aware. ### Assistant: I don\\'t think he is either. ### Human: he\\'s not either? ### Assistant: I doubt it. ### Human: Definitely let Mum know because she did tell me that she was going to have a chat to you about it. ### Assistant: When is it? ### Human: yes, because I wrote it down because I was going to check when you\\'d like our next session to be, on a Tuesday or before we have that appointment, the family appointment, to see what you were feeling would be a better option for yourself. ### Assistant: Before that, would be easier. ### Human: Yeah? ### Assistant: Just in case for some reason I\\'m not up to it or-- yeah. Before that. ### Human: Yeah. And we can definitely chat it through together if you like of what you\\'d like to say in the session. Would that be helpful? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah? So you can have a think about. So 3:30 would work right before, or would rather 3:00 to 4:00 and then have a half an hour break before the family session? ### Assistant: When\\'s this? ### Human: This is in two weeks, on a Thursday. ### Assistant: On a Thursday. Maybe do Tuesday or someday a week before we do it. ### Human: Yep. So a week before would be next week. Or we can do the same week, if you like. Your choice. ### Assistant: The same week, but a few days before maybe. ### Human: Yeah. So if we did the Tuesday, so I\\'ve written that down thinking you might want a different day, if we did 12:00 o\\'clock, would that be all right? ### Assistant: Should be. ### Human: Yep. ### Assistant: Should be all right. If not, Mum will change it. ### Human: Yeah. I can write it down and Mum can call to change it. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: And you can let Mum know that I was following up that you were aware of the family session and you can have a chat with her about it. We\\'ve definitively got. Was a late booking, so maybe Mum hasn\\'t had a chance yet to have a chat with both of you because you\\'ve been at Dad\\'s place. But you definitely have a heads up now, so it\\'s not a surprise. And we definitely book things in together, so if you\\'re not told that you\\'re coming, it\\'s your choice if you want to come. And that\\'s really i ### Assistant:  ### Human: It sounds like she\\'s got good intentions, but that communication\\'s probably a good reason for why it\\'ll be good to see her. Like you\\'ve just said, \"I\\'m open to it, but I\\'d like to know so I can get ready for it too.\" ### Assistant: Yeah. Normally if something came up, she\\'d text straight away about it, but. When was it booked? ### Human: I\\'m not sure because that was me who booked it in and that was from mum and Mum had said for both of you. When I spoke over the phone, she said she was going to check that both of you were open to the idea. So it sounds like-- ### Assistant: I guess you and I will have a chat about it. ### Human: Yeah. Maybe there\\'s just been some miscommunication and Mum hasn\\'t had that chat to both of you yet, and I\\'m a step ahead of myself when I\\'ve had that chat with you. ### Assistant: Yeah, I\\'ll speak with him about it to see what we do, if he wants to, and if he does, we\\'ll do it, if he doesn\\'t, and we\\'ll chat to Mum about it. ### Human: Yeah. And what are your thoughts about having that? ### Assistant: To be honest, I wouldn\\'t be 100% sure. ### Human: What would you like to get out of a session with both of you and Mum? ### Assistant: No idea, to be honest. I guess I feel uncomfortable speaking about sort of stuff with Mum, so I have no idea of what\\'d I do, that sort of thing, so. Yeah, I have no idea. ### Human: Would that help to focus on that next time together, and we can write down some dot points together? ### Assistant: Yeah, I guess. ### Human: Yeah? Totally your choice. ### Assistant: Yeah. I\\'ll think about it when I have the appointment, I guess. ### Human: You can think over it the next week and then see what could be helpful and we can brainstorm it so you\\'re feeling comfortable. And mum\\'s really experienced with working with the family and letting everyone have their voice in what\\'s going on. So I\\'m hearing you\\'d like things to be a bit different with Mum, but you\\'re not sure if change is possible. Is that my understanding? ### Assistant: Just whether or not I want to talk about sort of what I\\'ve gone through. ### Human: What\\'s stopping you from talking about it, you think? ### Assistant: Mum. ### Human: Mum? What about it? ### Assistant: How she takes things when you say it. She doesn\\'t exactly take things well. She gets very angry sometimes. Just in her eyes, she doesn\\'t believe she\\'s doing anything wrong. That\\'s just her. She doesn\\'t believe she\\'s doing anything wrong most of the time. ### Human: Yeah. So how do you think you could have that conversation now knowing that there\\'s this potential appointment with Mum? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. I guess I\\'d wait until Mum spoke about it to speak about it with her. I\\'d speak to her before. ### Human: Yeah. I hear both of you work as a united front together with talking things through? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Because things potentially won\\'t change if you don\\'t do some other work, potentially, so that could be good to have that space, and maybe it is the first session, you don\\'t feel too comfortable to say too much and hear what Mum has to say, but it could also be a good place to go, \"Hey, Mum, I do feel you take things personally, but this is how I\\'m feeling,\" so you can have that skill of being able to be confident, and it\\'s at a place where someone can mediate that conversation too. ### Assistant: Yeah. And I guess I\\'ll think about it over the next week. ### Human: Yeah. That sounds like a good plan. That\\'s totally your choice. It could be a good option for you to have the space with Mum. And we can definitely talk about it too, but we will talk about unless you\\'re feeling, \"No, I don\\'t really want to.\" It sounds like it can be a bit tricky with Mum, and the best way to be able to talk about it is to have her in the room so you can talk it through, which can be pretty scar in itself. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: What are you thinking? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. I\\'ll think about it over the next week and see what I want to do about it and speak to you about it. ### Human: Sounds like a good plan because we definitely want everyone to feel like it\\'s their choice around it, and I\\'m hearing it might be something Mum just hasn\\'t gotten around to having a chat about that week, because she definitely said she wanted to check with you boys to check that you both came, like , for young men. And we can check you on this stuff and see where you\\'re feeling with it. Sound good? ### Assistant: Yep. ### Human: I\\'ll turn this off. ### Assistant: Two session seven, RV, first of the eighth. .. How have you been since-- it was two weeks ago? ### Human: Two session seven, RV, first of the eighth. .. How have you been since-- it was two weeks ago? ### Assistant: Yeah. Yeah. Pretty well. ### Human: How\\'s school? ### Assistant: Yeah. Good. ### Human: Good. And new friends because you said last time there was some new people you were hanging out with. How are they? ### Assistant: Good. ### Human: Good. Same old. Yeah. What would you like to focus on today? ### Assistant: I\\'m not really sure to be honest. ### Human: Totally all good. We\\'d spoken about sleep in the family session last time. Did you want to focus on either of them first? ### Assistant: Don\\'t really know. ### Human: Your choice. Or something-- ### Assistant: min. ### Human: --else. That\\'s fine too. ### Assistant: I have no idea whatsoever. ### Human: Whatsoever. Did you want to start with sleep because I know I\\'ve got that here? Do you remember what we\\'d spoken about last time? How is your memory? ### Assistant: Not exactly. ### Human: What was our plan around if you heard a noise at night? Do you remember that? There were three things you were going to do. ### Assistant: Oh, that\\'s right. ### Human: I know it\\'s in the back of the brain there. In a memory there. ### Assistant: I decided to myself that it was nothing, and if I still wasn\\'t 100% sure, see if I can find the courage to get up. And if I-- ### Human: And there was one in between the two. ### Assistant: The first one was turning over. ### Human: Yes. Good memory. How did you go with them? How has sleep been? ### Assistant: I haven\\'t really done it as much because I\\'m starting to fall asleep now a lot earlier. ### Human: So tell me about that. What time are you going to sleep? Because last time you were adjusting to the time zone, so you were saying sleep was pretty easy. ### Assistant: At the moment I start falling to bed at around about 10:30. ### Human: And falling asleep at 10:30. That\\'s amazing. That\\'s a huge difference from-- I think when I first, first met you it was like 3:00 AM you couldn\\'t fall asleep till. What do you think\\'s changed? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know to be honest. I really have no idea. It might have been the weeks away because I don\\'t even really know what caused me to have all of the-- yeah. To have all of these problems with sleeping. So I don\\'t really know what happened. I found that I\\'ve been a lot more tired. Falling asleep around about 10:30ish now for the past three weeks. ### Human: Past three weeks. ### Assistant: What? ### Human: Any-- ### Assistant: Sorry. Past week and a half or something like that. ### Human: 1.5, yeah, weeks. And has it been that you\\'re hearing things or seeing the shadow? Because last time you were talking about the nightlight, and you can turn that off. ### Assistant: Yeah. I haven\\'t really been seeing a lot of things in my room, and I haven\\'t really been hearing things either. ### Human: And what do you think that\\'s about? ### Assistant: I don\\'t really know. So I\\'ve been normally going to bed at around about-- well, going into my room around about 10 o\\'clock, and I haven\\'t. ### Human: Around 10:00 PM. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. And I have found out really, you should fall asleep. I haven\\'t heard any noises, seen anything. Yeah. I\\'m not 100% sure why. ### Human: Are you feeling-- ### Assistant: Maybe because I\\'ve got a clear head. I don\\'t know. ### Human: Yeah. And what is it about that you feel you\\'ve got a clear head? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. It just feels like-- ### Human: That\\'s a good thing. I\\'m just-- ### Assistant: --there\\'s nothing on my mind. Yeah. ### Human: Nothing on my mind. Yeah. That\\'s what I\\'m hearing. Okay. I\\'ll draw another piece of paper, such is my scribbles. So when you\\'re increased feeling, stressed, or things on your mind, yeah? On your mind. Then that increases noises. Is that a-- I hear a yeah. Yeah? ### Assistant: hours. The past week and a half, nothing\\'s been really on my mind. So I can sleep. Wake up the next day. Go back to school. I\\'ve been enjoying school a lot more. ### Human: That\\'s a huge difference because even two months ago you were like, \"I\\'m not really enjoying it.\" What\\'s made school-- ### Assistant: I think the fact that I\\'m now-- next year I\\'m doing it. ### Human: Wow. What\\'s made that decision ?-- ### Assistant: I guess the fact that I-- ### Human: --for next year? ### Assistant: --don\\'t like the whole idea of going to university or just doing-- I sort of learn a lot more practically. So if you put something in front of me, and it was a drawing or something like that, I\\'d more likely be able to understand that. If you just wrote it on the board or something like that. And I\\'ve sort of picked things up by watching people do them or doing it myself. ### Human: Yeah. So you\\'re a more hands-on kind of person. ### Assistant: And Mom said I\\'ve always been like that, and it\\'s only recently that my math-- I\\'m enjoying my math because it\\'s a more hands-on, more practical side of things. And now with this, I\\'m not just sitting in a classroom all the time. I\\'m actually getting outside, doing trade school on one day of the week. ### Human: Is that next year, or is this-- ### Assistant: This is next year. ### Human: Next year. So just checking because you haven\\'t done anything, you being in the usual school. Does your school do the same? You\\'re going to look at me blankly and go what-- ### Assistant: I think they do. I think they do because there\\'s a few kids that are doing well this year. ### Human: Yeah. And so what trade will you do, or you\\'re thinking? ### Assistant: I\\'m doing certificate two in plumbing, pre-apprenticeship. ### Human: Certificate two plumbing. I\\'m writing it down so that I can memorize it because my way of remembering things is I write it down, it goes more in my brain. That\\'s why you\\'ll see me write a bit because it helps me remember. What\\'s the choice of plumbing? ### Assistant: Well, I did go through-- well, I didn\\'t go through-- I went through a very long time of-- my mom\\'s always been a nurse, and my dad was a nurse. And when we were born, he decided to change because they needed flexible time, so. Because Mom and Dad were both waking up extremely early. ### Human: So they were doing shift work. ### Assistant: And Mom was doing nights. So Dad went out and did his-- his job was just building at this stage. When we were born, Mom would stay home with us when we were newborn, and then Dad would come home, Mom would go off and work nights at the local Hospital. So we\\'ve grown up with Mom being a nurse and Dad always being a builder. A carpenter. So dad and I were both very set on becoming carpenters or builders. Anything to do with wood because that\\'s what we\\'ve grown up around. We\\'ve grow ### Human: And why plumbing or the sparkie or carpentry? What is it that-- ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. I found it just that bit more interesting, and obviously, I wanted to sit and look at something different. Obviously, it goes plumbing, carpentry, sparkie on that side of things. ### Human: Yeah. Because I\\'m hearing bricklayer wouldn\\'t be for you because it would be quite routine. Doing the same thing, yeah? ### Assistant: So it sort of-- and so yeah, Dad told me to go out, look at some different things, that sort of thing, and I sort of looked at plumbing, and I saw it is sort of interesting. \"Oh, what\\'s that about?\" And I was speaking to one of the people that-- because our school had some people come out and talk to us about some jobs, and sort of spoke to me about it, and sort of I found it interesting, and all the stuff you can do. In fact you can do gutters, sewage, fire sprinklers, normal household plum ### Human: And this is certificate three. Is that-- ### Assistant: So-- ### Human: --the one you\\'re doing next year, is that right, or is it the one-- ### Assistant: Next year it\\'ll be certificate two. ### Human: Certificate two. Yeah. I did write two there, see? I wrote it down and didn\\'t go into the memory. ### Assistant: Yeah. So I\\'ll be doing certificate two pre-apprenticeship-- ### Human: Pre-apprenticeship. Yeah. ### Assistant: --next year, and I\\'m pretty sure-- yeah. Sorry. Next year\\'s year 11. ### Human: Next year\\'s year 11. You have got it right. ### Assistant: Year 12 I think we do two again. ### Human: Finish it off or so. Is it over two years? ### Assistant: I think it\\'s a two-year course. And then I can go off to london to get a certificate three. ### Human: Which is? Which is it? - that does it here, or is it-- ### Assistant: There\\'s Melbourne Polytechnic. So they have one in Preston, Bundoora. ### Human: There\\'s another one somewhere. Yeah. ### Assistant: Somewhere else. And you can go off and get a certificate three, and that\\'s what most employers expect. So-- ### Human: That\\'s the standard. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. That\\'s the standard. So if someone was certificate two, and you\\'re certificate three, you\\'d get looked at over them because they see you have more experience. So yeah, I think it\\'s two-year. So I\\'d do the certificate two in plumbing over the two years until I finish year 12, and then I can go off, and I can do step three, step four, step five, and that\\'s it. ### Human: Five or is to six, you said? You said five. ### Assistant: I think it only goes up to-- I think it\\'s five. Yeah. ### Human: Five. I think it\\'s five years. Good job with the math. ### Assistant: Yeah. So it goes all the way up to certificate five. So I can do certificate-- I think there\\'s only four-month courses, and extremely-- ### Human: Oh, so it\\'s not very long. Yeah. ### Assistant: --quick compared to other jobs. I was so like, \"Oh, I don\\'t want to sit in--\" because my cousin\\'s doing nursing, and she\\'s-- doesn\\'t go in a lot, and it\\'s mostly online, but she\\'s doing it-- I think it\\'s a two-year course. And my cousin did ag science, and he did-- ### Human: Agriculture science. Yeah. ### Assistant: --three years. And I also had four kids that have gone into university. So four cousins that have gone into university. ### Human: Yeah. I\\'m like, \"Four kids. Yeah.\" ### Assistant: So one\\'s doing forensic science, and she\\'s only just gone to uni. And also one that\\'s done stuff to do with genes and-- ### Human: Genetics. ### Assistant: Genetics. Yeah. ### Human: Something under biology class. ### Assistant: It\\'s something under that sort of-- I\\'m not 100% sure. And she\\'s done a couple of years. I think she did two, and she has to still go back and do more because she found out that she didn\\'t do enough subjects. So she had to go back and do summer school this year to finish off, and then she can look at getting a job. So I was sort of like, \"I don\\'t want to sit there for two, three years doing that sort of stuff.\" So when I found out they\\'re only four-month courses, if I was to get all the way ### Human: And I can see you\\'re really excited about this. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. I could even do-- so I can even go up to certificate four and do another month, and then have two, three years and go, or have a year and then go, \"You know what? I want to go off and do all the way up to certificate five,\" and then that\\'s another eight months. So they\\'re not long. ### Human: And it sounds like for you, that\\'s what you\\'re after. Something not too long. ### Assistant: Yeah. Something that\\'s not too long because I hate being in a classroom, and I\\'ve always been outdoors. ### Human: And the-- ### Assistant: With sport, that sort of thing. So-- ### Human: And is footie, as we have it written down here, is that where it is now, or has that changed now? .. ### Assistant: Coming into finals, Wednesdays and Fridays and Sundays will all be free. So from-- ### Human: Wednesdays and Fridays. Yeah. That\\'s a big change. ### Assistant: Yeah. So Sundays will be all-- yeah. So Sundays will be free. Friday after school will be free. And Wednesday after school will be free. So basically, I go from doing heaps of stuff to doing nothing. ### Human: Yeah. So what\\'s that going to be like? ### Assistant: And then Tuesday\\'s coming for Calder Cannons, I\\'m pretty sure. ### Human: So we can talk. ### Assistant: If I get invited back to Calder Cannons, I can do the-- ### Human: Is that likely, that you\\'d get invited back? ### Assistant: Depends how I went. Because we did little practice matches against the Knights and all that sort of stuff. So other things, like the Calder Cannons. So we went off and did matches against them, just here in the city. And so it\\'ll either be the fact that if I did well enough, I\\'ll be invited back, and if I didn\\'t, obviously, I\\'ll just continue at college level football. And then stick around to next year, and then-- ### Human: And you\\'re okay with either if it happens. ### Assistant: I guess if they are cutting you, it\\'s for a reason. It\\'s not the fact that, \"Oh, we\\'re cutting you--\" they\\'re just going to cut you. oh, and that gives you something to improve on. So if they go, \"Oh, your fitness wasn\\'t up to scratch,\" or, \"Your kicking wasn\\'t up to scratch,\" I can spend from the end of footie season all the way up to next year\\'s footie season trying to get them on track. So that means that if I\\'m going out and kicking the football more often, or I\\'m going out and ### Human: You\\'re getting such a nice way of, \"So how can I improve if they haven\\'t chosen me?\" ### Assistant: So it\\'s not the fact that they\\'re just going to get kicked out. \"You\\'re kicked out now. See you. We won\\'t have you back. You may never come back.\" But if you try hard enough and you have the motivation to do it, you\\'re most likely to come back. ### Human: And I\\'m hearing you definitely have that motivation, and a really nice, \"Okay. They didn\\'t choose me for this reason, but if I improve, they could choose me.\" Such a nice way to think about it. ### Assistant: Yeah. So it just all depends. It\\'ll come down to, obviously, how I went in the normal football season. They\\'ll look at how I went in there. ### Human: Yeah. And how is your-- you had an infection. Have you been able to play, or how is that all going? ### Assistant: That\\'s technically fine because it\\'s healed up. ### Human: Because you said Mom got some tests and stuff done. ### Assistant: Yeah. Well, it\\'s perfectly fine now, but it was-- ### Human: n. Oh. ### Assistant: But yeah, it\\'s perfectly fine now. ### Human: You can see that the skin\\'s-- yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. That\\'s where it was, right under the ankle, and that\\'s all the skin that\\'s all dried off. ### Human: It\\'ll slowly grow back. ### Assistant: Yeah. I\\'ll always have a flat ankle now. I\\'ll always have a bit of skin missing on the end of my ankle, so it won\\'t be fully-- but yeah, it\\'s healed and it\\'s okay to touch. ### Human: That\\'s good because nothing worse than you do that and it really hurts. ### Assistant: Oh, but at that stage I couldn\\'t-- this ankle here, that amount of pressure then was absolutely killing because it would spread out over my ankle like that. ### Human: It\\'d be very painful. ### Assistant: And I couldn\\'t walk for-- I found it hard to walk because I would be walking with my foot like that so the pressure was off the leg. It was all-- ### Human: Not your usual way of walking. ### Assistant: Yeah. So I\\'d be walking like-- I\\'d be walking with-- instead of walking like that like you normally do, I\\'d walk sort of-- ### Human: m. Yeah. ### Assistant: Invert my foot in so the pressure wasn\\'t exactly on the inside of my shoe. So it was extremely hard with running as well. Now I can run perfectly fine in boots and that sort of stuff. So I guess, yeah, it\\'s gotten a lot better from what it was. ### Human: Even in the two weeks we\\'re seeing you, it sounds like it\\'s improved so much. ### Assistant: It\\'s improved a heck of a lot, considering when it first happened and the files that Mom had of it. And now, the fact that it\\'s gotten to where you wouldn\\'t even know it was there. ### Human: And how are things going with Mom at the moment? ### Assistant: All right. ### Human: All right. What\\'s changed that it\\'s all right? ### Assistant: I\\'m not 100% sure to be honest. I sort of just haven\\'t bothered to-- I sort of just-- when I get home Mom\\'s like-- don\\'t do a lot of stuff with me anymore. It\\'s sort of steering away from her. Not too much. The fact that she feels like we\\'re totally trying to ignore her and not doing anything with her, but sort of keeping her out of-- sort of it\\'s more her and I doing stuff than rather Mom. ### Human: What do you mean? Just so I\\'m understanding. ### Assistant: So it would just be mom and I on the computers, and it wouldn\\'t be exactly Mom being around us. That sort of thing. So it was only just mom and I sort of not confrontating with Mom as much. So-- ### Human: And how are you not confrontating ?? ### Assistant: By sort of not talking a lot to Mom as I used to. Trying to avoid me saying something, or me getting angry at Mom or something like that. So sort of avoiding that side of things. ### Human: And is that the way you\\'d like things to be? Would you like them to be different? ### Assistant: At the moment it\\'s working, so, and I\\'m a lot happier because of it. ### Human: Do you think it\\'ll work in the long term, or would you like it to look different? ### Assistant: I guess it\\'ll work till the end of the year at least. And then obviously, we\\'ve got to address what we do then. Whether or not we keep being with Mom as much as we are because at that stage, things don\\'t exactly get taken to court. ### Human: Yeah. Because you\\'re 16 then. Yeah. ### Assistant: Because we\\'re 16. That\\'s my understanding of it at the moment. That and I sort of don\\'t want to take it to court because we\\'re sort of getting to the point where we can make our decisions. That sort of stuff, so. ### Human: And how would you like things to look like with Mom? I know that\\'s a big question. ### Assistant: Sort of seeing her for a few days, and spending that time without-- I guess, without it being annoying or getting annoyed by Mom. ### Human: Without being annoyed by Mom. Yeah. ### Assistant: So being happy while we\\'re there, instead of being miserable. That sort of stuff. ### Human: That sounds like a really lovely thing that you\\'d want. Are you planning to have the family session this week? ### Assistant: I have no idea. Mom still hasn\\'t spoken to me about the family session at all. So I don\\'t know if it\\'s happening at all. ### Human: What are your thoughts about it? I can definitely check if it\\'s still on. ### Assistant: I\\'m not exactly keen on it. ### Human: Yeah. What makes you not keen on it? ### Assistant: Because I know she won\\'t listen because we\\'ve done a lot of stuff in the past with Mom and Dad, and she hasn\\'t exactly listened. ### Human: And how has she-- ### Assistant: She doesn\\'t because that\\'s just Mom. And our uncle, which is Mom\\'s brother, knows that she\\'s never going to-- she\\'s never going to listen because if something is her idea, she\\'s used to it. So that\\'s what-- ### Human: She died. ### Assistant: That\\'s just her, and he said that she\\'s not going to change for a very, very long time, until she ends up losing something that-- - or us going in different direction away from them. She may end up listening or figuring out. But she said at the moment she may only realize that until she\\'s a lot older, when she looks back at what happened. ### Human: And would it be helpful too if you had the session on Thursday, to plan together what you\\'d like to say? ### Assistant: : I\\'m just not keen on talking to Mom. ### Human: Yeah. Because you\\'re saying Mom won\\'t listen. Is that-- ### Assistant: Yeah. And just sort of I don\\'t like having these sorts of conversations with Mom. ### Human: Would it be-- ### Assistant: Because it always ends here. ### Human: --helpful to say that\\'s the topic of conversation? To go, \"I\\'m really not comfortable because I feel nothing\\'s going to change.\" Is that something you could say? ### Assistant: To be honest, I don\\'t know. ### Human: Because that says a lot to me, you saying that will-- \"I currently don\\'t know if there\\'s any point in talking because I don\\'t feel things can change.\" That\\'s a really hard thing to say. Totally your choice of what you will say, but I thought we could use the space to practice that to see what you feel comfortable-- how it sounds. ### Assistant: Yeah. It\\'s just at the moment I might rethink it. It\\'s just at the moment I sort of just want to keep going because I know that we\\'ll start talking about stuff, and I\\'ll either get angry or-- and then I\\'ll end up being unhappy. And that\\'s what sort of happens-- ### Human: As in here right now, or in a session with Mom? ### Assistant: In a session with Mom because I\\'ve spoken to Mom in the past, and it\\'s taken me weeks, even longer to get over it because I-- ### Human: So-- ### Assistant: --get so angry, or-- ### Human: Can we do a hypothetical? If you have the session on Thursday, you start feeling angry, what can you do? Because I\\'m hearing that\\'s what you don\\'t want to happen. So if those feelings-- what happens in your body when you start feeling angry? Because that\\'s the first step to recognize. ### Assistant: I end up don\\'t listening. Not-- ### Human: Yeah. Not listening. Yeah. Is there anything that goes on in your body? ### Assistant: Sort of just bottle it up. ### Human: Yeah. So if you start feeling you\\'re bottling it up, what can you do in that situation? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. ### Human: What do you think would be helpful? So what\\'s important for me is that you can feel that you\\'re okay in a session so that you\\'re not feeling then not okay for a few weeks. And I can pass this information on to her also, so she knows. So I can throw out a few ideas if that\\'ll be helpful. ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: Yeah. So it could be you go, \"I\\'m not feeling okay. I\\'m going to walk out for a break.\" You could have a system of a word or a card that you put down, saying, \"I need a break,\" or, \"I\\'m not feeling comfortable.\" What do you think could work? ### Assistant: I don\\'t know. ### Human: I can see in your face now, \"I\\'m really not comfortable with this session,\" and I\\'m pretty sure it is booked in. It\\'d be good to either chat to Mom about it, or if you are coming in here-- because I want you to feel okay in the session. ### Assistant: Yeah. Mom at the moment is the fact that she doesn\\'t see harm. She sees it as something wrong with us, not with her, and she sort of does this sort of stuff helping us, but the fact that she actually should be getting help for herself. The reason why we did headspace was to get help for us from all that sort of stuff, and yeah, but she never did anything for her. And that\\'s what was really-- the problem was the fact that the way she was dealing with stuff when we spoke about Dad when we were ### Human: And do you think you have a problem? ### Assistant: I don\\'t see myself as having an attitude problem whenever-- all that sort of stuff that she says that I do. She says I have an attitude problem, or it\\'s because of someone-- ### Human: What do you mean-- ### Assistant: --else, but she doesn\\'t accept that it\\'s not the way-- she always saw it as the fact that she is doing no wrong, and that she\\'s not hurting anyone by doing anything, and the fact that she\\'s doing the best. She may be doing the best, but in her eyes it\\'s-- in my eyes especially, she\\'s not-- ### Human: So I\\'m hearing that in her eyes she\\'s doing the best she can, and to you it\\'s why I\\'d like Mom to do a few things differently, but that\\'s really hard to say to Mom because you feel she won\\'t listen to what you say. ### Assistant: Well, she doesn\\'t because she has an idea in her head, and she doesn\\'t-- she\\'ll have an idea in her head, and she\\'ll pretend she is listening to someone else, but really, she knows what she\\'s going to do, and that\\'s whatever she wants to do, and that\\'s how she\\'s always been. And I was speaking to Dad, and when we used to be annoying when we were kids, she used to punish us by hitting us with a wooden spoon, and Dad said that he didn\\'t want that. Yelling at us was something. So that is someth ### Human: Yeah. So it sounds like the way they parent is very different. ### Assistant: Yeah. Dad was always the fact that yelling or talking would be a better option than hitting or with force, and that\\'s how Mom grew up, and that\\'s how she-- and that\\'s how she\\'s had it, so that\\'s how she does it. And Dad grew up with being spoken to or yelled or that sort of thing instead of being hit, and that\\'s what he didn\\'t agree with. And the fact that he said that Mom\\'s always been like that, and her uncle said that she\\'s always been like that because when she gets an idea in her head, ### Human: Would it be helpful to talk to Mom about cutting the session? ### Assistant: So I\\'ve sort of given up on talking to her, and-- ### Human: Is that something where you feel you go, \"At the moment I feel it\\'s really hard to talk to you because I feel you dismiss me\"? ### Assistant: Well, I think it makes me a lot happier when I don\\'t talk about that sort of stuff. I sort of try to push that stuff aside so I can be close enough to a kid with a normal life because obviously, it\\'s never going to be normal. ### Human: What is a normal life? ### Assistant: Having two parents that live together with their kids in one house. That sort of thing. ### Human: And why is that a normal life? ### Assistant: Because that\\'s what most kids have. ### Human: Is that what most kids have though? ### Assistant: Most kids do. ### Human: Well, I would say-- ### Assistant: Some kids have other lives, where they either don\\'t have a dad, they don\\'t a mom, or they don\\'t have parents at all, and I see that as the fact that they don\\'t exactly have-- yeah. They don\\'t have something that every kid is born into, where they have a mom and a dad, and they both live together, and they both are in some sort of building. ### Human: And that is ,-- ### Assistant: A house or-- ### Human: So --- ### Assistant: --apartment. That sort of stuff. ### Human: Which is society\\'s expectations because there\\'s a lot of people, Mom and Dad aren\\'t together, some people have two moms or two dads. It\\'s not necessary that it\\'s a mom or dad, and things can happen, and things can change, but I can understand you\\'ve grown up for 14 years, roughly, with Mom and Dad. ### Assistant: Yeah. I grew for a long time with me knowing that, and then I\\'ve considered that-- now, looking back at it, I considered that that was my normal life, and it\\'s changed, and I\\'ve found myself a lot happier when I was back there. So I sort of push that sort of side of stuff away. All the things to do with court. Stuff to do with Mom and Dad-- ### Human: Because that\\'s-- ### Assistant: --away, and sort of focused on friends, socializing, sport, that sort of stuff, and sort of tried to get it as close to what it was like before it all happened. ### Human: And these are the things that I can feel you have control over. Your friends, sport, but with family, you haven\\'t had a lot of control over. Am I hearing? ### Assistant: Yeah. And I\\'ve spoken to a friend about that, and he said that he doesn\\'t really bother about his mom and dad at all, not being together. He sort of focuses on the fact before that. And-- ### Human: So those things that were there before parents separated. Is that right? ### Assistant: Yeah. ### Human: I\\'m thinking I\\'m getting it. ### Assistant: Because he\\'s got stepsisters as well. He\\'s got a stepsister and a stepbrother, and he also has his real brother, and he also has a real sister. And he sort of focused on before that, and he said that it helped him a lot, and it still does. So I\\'ve sort of done that, and have found myself to be a lot happier because it\\'s been the fact that I\\'ve gone back to before it even happened, the most happiest memory I had, and that\\'s, I guess-- I sort of found that out, and I\\'ve tried to focus, and it\\' ### Human: And totally understandable. ### Assistant: Yeah. And yeah, it\\'s what could have gotten happier and not talking about this sort of stuff and not bothering about the sort of problems and trying to focus on-- yeah. Trying to focus on what happened before. ### Human: And if you want to talk about that stuff, this is where we can talk about it. It\\'s a safe place to talk about that kind of stuff. Because sometimes if we put a lot of things aside one day, they can all come up and become overwhelming, for some people. But it\\'s really important to find those things that you can find you do have control over because you\\'ve gone through a lot in the past year. A lot of changes. So it makes sense that your friends and your sport are things you\\'re focusing on bec ### Assistant:  ### Human: And do you feel you still have Mom and Dad? ### Assistant: Yeah. I just don\\'t think of them as Mom and Dad. I think of them as Mom and Dad-- ### Human: Yeah. I get what you mean. Yeah. ### Assistant: Yeah. I don\\'t think of them as Mom and Dad. ### Human: Mom and Dad. Yeah. ### Assistant: I think, yeah, they\\'re still Mom and Dad, but I think before they were Mom and Dad. ### Human: Yeah. So now you think of it as Mom-- ### Assistant: I think of them as Mom and Dad. ### Human: Mom, Dad, and it was Mom and Dad. That, yeah? ### Assistant: Yeah. So instead of having Mom here and Dad there, I see them as, yeah, they\\'re there, but I still have Mom and Dad. ### Human: Yeah. We\\'re on the same page. We\\'re wording it in the way it processes in our head on the same page, and that\\'s really important to remember, that you do have-- Mom\\'s still there and Dad\\'s still there. ### Assistant: It\\'s just they\\'re not there if you know what I mean. They\\'re not always there. Dad\\'s not always going to be there every single day, Mom\\'s not always going to be there every single day, but I still have Mom and Dad. ### Human: And that\\'s really important to remember, and they would care about you just as much as they did before they were separated, but it\\'d be very hard, I\\'d imagine, to process that it\\'s not Mom and Dad under the same roof. \"-- ### Assistant: Yeah. And I\\'ve tried to focus on the fact that, yeah, Dad\\'s not with us every single day. He\\'s not coming home. We don\\'t see him in the morning every single day. But yet, we still see Dad and we still see Mom. ### Human: Yeah. That\\'s exactly right. And it sounds like it\\'s been hard with now understanding how things work with Mom because you feel that she dismisses a lot of what you say, yeah? Was that like that before? ### Assistant: It still was. ### Human: Was. Yeah. ### Assistant: It was just Mom, and I sort of figured out that that\\'s always been Mom, and recently speaking to her uncle, he said that Mom\\'s always been like that, even when she was-- yeah. Even before this, she was always like that, and he says-- ### Human: And I-- ### Assistant: --she\\'s not going to change for a very long time. ### Human: And I wonder if she doesn\\'t even realize that she does this because it\\'s just automatic. ### Assistant: Because it\\'s just her. ### Human: Yeah. So it could be helpful for you to mention this goes on in a gentle way, but I get that would be-- ### Assistant: Yeah. I guess, just sort of calm. If that\\'s always been her, you sort of can\\'t say to someone, \"Oh, that\\'s your personality, but I don\\'t like it, so can you change it?\" So I see that as that\\'s Mom\\'s personality, and it is Mom\\'s personality. No, not her personally. That\\'s what she does, and saying, \"All right. You\\'re doing this, but I want you to totally, completely scrap that and take on this.\" I see that as the fact that it may take an extremely long time, and I don\\'t see that as-- ### Human: Is it something that you think would be helpful for you? ### Assistant: That over time. I reckon that it would take her more than a few months. I reckon it\\'ll take up to two, three years for her to figure out-- ### Human: Yeah. And you\\'re right. It could take-- ### Assistant: --or change little things. Even to change one little thing, it may take her a year and a half, or it may even take her longer. I see that as sort of a very-- ### Human: Long term. ### Assistant: Something that goes for a long time. Something that goes for a long time, but with very-- ### Human: No. You\\'re making sense. Yeah. ### Assistant: I\\'m trying to figure out a word. For something that goes on and someone that is trying to change that goes on for a very long time, you only get little bits every time. So it\\'s sort of like over four or five years, but you only get tiny bits. ### Human: So slowly, slowly over four and five years. ### Assistant: But yet the fact that if, I guess-- I\\'m finding it hard to work. I\\'m trying to find the right words. I guess if you sort of-- I guess dismiss that. I guess you can sort of figure out ways to get around it, and that\\'s what I don\\'t have at the moment, and that\\'s ways of getting around how Mom works. Not her personality. It\\'s how she works. ### Human: What do you mean by that because I think I 80% understand what you mean? ### Assistant: So how she has parented us for our whole lives, and that\\'s how when she-- I\\'m trying to-- that\\'s how her brain-- that\\'s how her brain works. ### Human: Yeah. Because that\\'s the way it\\'s always been. ### Assistant: So when she has-- yeah. This is the way it\\'s always been because when she has an idea in her head, her brain goes, \"All right. That\\'s what I\\'m going to do.\" And she\\'s done that for her whole life, and it\\'s something that you\\'ve done. So I haven\\'t liked lamb and pork for a very long time, and trying to eat those sort of things, it sort of goes, \"No. I don\\'t like that. I\\'m not going to eat it.\" And it takes a long time to get back to eat it because it\\'s taking me a long time to even start eati ### Human: Yeah. You\\'re telling me that change is possible there. ### Assistant: But over a very long time. When it happened, I wasn\\'t eating any pork, any lamb, and hardly any beef. I was only eating sausages. Things that I really enjoyed. And it\\'s taken me four or five years to get back into eating a lot more meats and eating a lot more parts of beef. Eating a bit more pork. It\\'s taken me something like three years to eat little cubes of bacon. Even though they\\'re tiny, little things, it\\'s taking me so long, and it\\'s had a lot of effort from me. Something that yo ### Human: Was it worth it? ### Assistant: It was. ### Human: So-- ### Assistant: But it took me a very-- it took me an extremely long time, and I succeeded, yeah, but for me, just to eat tiny cubes of bacon, and I spent three years trying to eat tiny cubes of bacon. I see that as the fact that for the amount of effort you put in, it\\'s only tiny. ### Human: But you told me it was worth it. ### Assistant: Yeah. It was, but over a long period of time. Yeah. It may be worth it, but I think maybe when I have a bit more freedom-- this is important for next year because we\\'re almost adults, we have more freedom. We can do more things because I don\\'t have to wait until Wednesday when we go back to Dad\\'s, or I don\\'t have to wait until Sunday. Sorry. I don\\'t have to wait till Friday to get back to Dad\\'s. ### Human: What\\'s freedom look like? ### Assistant: Me being able to stay at Mom and Dad\\'s whenever I want. So I might have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays for an example with Dad, and I might spend Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday with Mom if I feel like it. Or I can jump between Mom and Dad\\'s place without getting in trouble for it. ### Human: Well, I can go to Mom and Dad\\'s. What other things? ### Assistant: That\\'s what I see as freedom, and then to go down the street, or getting to do things with Dad, and not seeing Dad-- so Mom not having a go at how Dad parents. That\\'s how I see it as. ### Human: Yeah. Because it\\'s your choice where you want to go. ### Assistant: Yeah. But Mom has always seen it as Dad\\'s doing. So if we went to Dad\\'s after Mom and-- dad and I used to fight with Mom. We went to Dad\\'s a few times. Mom saw that as Dad getting us to come here when it was out of hours, and that\\'s what we found as us being in this little box where we can just be moved and moved and moved wherever we want. So my freedom is to be able to go between Mom and Dad\\'s house and being able to be more independent. Being able to choose what I want to do and wh ### Human: Is that something that you could talk to Mom about in a session with dad, around wanting more independence? What can that look like for the next six months? ### Assistant: Mostly, again, the fact that that\\'s how Mom\\'s always done stuff because she wasn\\'t allowed to do that sort of stuff. That\\'s how she sees as what we should be brought up as. That\\'s how she was brought up. So she\\'s like, \"Well, it worked, so I\\'m going to do it.\" And-- ### Human: Do you think there\\'s any smaller ways that work that maybe you can have a little bit more freedom? Because you are turning 16. So that makes sense you want more independence. And I\\'m wondering if you were to-- ### Assistant: Especially your driving. You\\'re learning to drive. That\\'s a stack of independence in itself. ### Human: Is that a way we can word in the session? So not saying, \"Mom, I feel dismissed by you.\" It\\'s, \"Mom, I would like more independence. What can we do about that so that I\\'m feeling happier?\" ### Assistant: At the moment because of the court orders and all that sort of stuff, we have set days. And that\\'s what I don\\'t want is set days where you have to be here, you have to be here. I want sort of days you can be here, and you can be here. You don\\'t have to be here, and you don\\'t have to be here. Have to and can is what I want to change. Is the fact that you have to be at Mom\\'s on these days. You have to be at Dad\\'s on these days. Otherwise, you get in trouble. It\\'s not that you can be at Dad\\'s o ### Human: And is that something reasonable right now, or is that something you feel in six months\\' time? ### Assistant: I feel in six months\\' time would be a lot more easier because A, with 16 you get to decide, and we can jump between houses, but we can sort of, I think, explain to Mom that\\'s why we did it. Just the fact that-- I just lost what I was about to say then. Sorry. ### Human: The can. I\\'ve written it down. The have to, the can. What is it-- ### Assistant: Because that\\'s what we wanted to do. So we saw that as a fact because now we\\'ve got that tiny bit of freedom to bounce between houses. I guess we can build up the fact that that\\'s why we did it, was to get that. ### Human: Maybe it\\'s also around Mom because you said going down the street\\'s hard for Mom. Is there a way that she can feel more comfortable for you to do that? Say, during the day. You\\'ve got your phone on. You\\'re somewhere. She can build trust with you. ### Assistant: She sort of sees that as people hanging around the shops or going to the shops by themselves. It\\'s just kids. She says that is thuggish. So all the kids that muck around or cause trouble. That sort of stuff. That\\'s what she sees that as. And-- ### Human: Is there a middle ground do you think you can come up with that? Because I think that\\'ll be good for her to know something important to you is to be more independent. ### Assistant: Yeah. I don\\'t really know to be honest. ### Human: And maybe that\\'s why we need Mom in the room to go, \"Well, what is okay?\" What isn\\'t okay to Mom? What can she find as a middle ground? ### Assistant: The other side of it is the fact that I don\\'t exactly want to be in there with Mom. That\\'s the other side of it, yeah, if we were to have it, but I don\\'t exactly want to be in there when it happens. Yeah. Mom goes in, and then she comes in and speaks to us, and then goes back in. Swap in and out and that sort of thing. But I don\\'t exactly want to be in there with Mom. ### Human: And it\\'s your choice if you want to have the session. As I said last time, I\\'m not forcing you, that you need to go or whatnot. That opportunity is there. If you don\\'t want to do it, that\\'s okay too. And I didn\\'t mention last time because I know it\\'s you and me because I could sit in with you also, but then I know he doesn\\'t have someone else sitting in with him. So I wasn\\'t sure what you would think about that too because I want it to be even for both of you too. ### Assistant: Yeah. I guess I\\'m going to speak to dad about it, and I know he\\'s probably going to go no, but I\\'ll speak to him anyway. And I reckon at a later stage it would be a lot easier, like I said because when we had that bit of freedom, where the fact that we can go between houses, and if Mom doesn\\'t like it, she\\'s not exactly going to get looked at at court. That\\'s the thing that I want Mom to get out of her head, that if we want to do something, if we want to stay at Dad\\'s for that sort of ### Human: And I\\'m hearing-- ### Assistant: --and a half. The fact that she\\'s relied on court has been the fact-- you can\\'t just buy court orders. When something\\'s put in-- something. Something is put in-- my tongue\\'s getting a bit lazy. It\\'s been like this all day. ### Human: You\\'re right. End of the day. ### Assistant: It\\'s slurry. My voice gets extremely slurry when it gets to the end of the day. In the morning and close to the end of the day. ### Human: You\\'ve been good when we\\'ve had other afternoon appointments. ### Assistant: Yeah. It\\'s just I have no idea why, but the past few weeks I\\'ve had an extremely slurry voice. It\\'s-- ### Human: I wonder what that\\'s about. ### Assistant: I have no idea. It\\'s just I can\\'t find the words. Anyway. So it\\'s just I wanted to stop relying-- the fact that, yeah, because as a citizen of Australia, you can\\'t really disobey the court orders because you\\'re here and the court\\'s there. So they\\'re higher, and the waiver they put in place is-- obviously, you have to obey it, like you have to pay a parking fine. You have to pay a speeding ticket. You have to do this. If you kill someone, that\\'s your sentence. You have to do it. So I sort of ### Human: And it could be a good idea to speak about it sooner, so you know this is what I\\'m thinking. How we can we find that middle ground? And I know that\\'s a really hard thing to do with Mom, and if you\\'re feeling it\\'s something you want the two of us with Mom to say in the future, we can do that too because I want to work with you. I don\\'t want you to feel I\\'m telling you what to do because you are an independent young man, and that\\'s so important to you, to be independent. And if you ever feel I ### Assistant:  ### Human: Would it be better to do it a little bit sooner, so Mom has a bit of a heads-up too? Your choice. ### Assistant: I was sort of aiming to do it before January. Our birthday\\'s on the way. So she at least has-- I was going to say something. Then I lost it again. Second time. ### Human: So you can kind of-- get back together? ### Assistant: So she has that time to sort of say, \"All right. Well, instead of doing this or--\" Because I know if we say it now, I know she\\'s going to-- I know exactly what she\\'s going to do, and she\\'s going to go straight to court with it, and I just fear the fact that the courts will stop us from doing it. That\\'s why I don\\'t want-- I want to give her enough time to comprehend it, but not enough time to organize something to go with court because I know that she-- now, she may not or she may, but I don\\' ### Human: So I\\'m hearing you\\'d like something to be put in place without the courts involved. ### Assistant: Yes. So I see the fact that giving her notice, but not enough for her to make action to it. If that sort of makes sense. ### Human: Yeah, no. That makes sense. ### Assistant: So she has time to think on it like, \"I don\\'t want them to, so what can I do?\" or, \"We can talk.\" So we can maybe talk for two or three days. ### Human: We-- ### Assistant: But also, the other thing is the fact that I don\\'t want her parents to be there - so her nana and granddad - because that\\'s also-- the fact that they side with her because obviously, that\\'s their-- ### Human: It\\'s their daughter. Yeah. ### Assistant: That\\'s their daughter. So they\\'re going to say also sort of like, \"Well, Mom\\'s doing the best for it,\" and like I said, she is probably doing the best, but in our eyes, and especially in mine-- I know that , on the same page. To us it feels like she isn\\'t trying hard enough, and they\\'re going to see-- ### Human: What would you like her to do? What would her trying hard enough look like for you? ### Assistant: The biggest part of her trying her hardest is giving us a bit of independence to do whatever. To jump between houses. So let\\'s say I had my football stuff at Dad\\'s, and I have it there as well. I had my football stuff at Dad\\'s, and I texted her and said, \"Look. I was planning on going back to Dad\\'s. I was going to get changed there, walk to football training,\" because it\\'s literally only a two-minute walk. \" over the road, \"and go to football training, and you can take me hom ### Human: Yeah. And I\\'m hearing-- ### Assistant: And Mom didn\\'t see that as-- Mom saw that as me going there and spending more time with Dad, which she doesn\\'t like, when she\\'s meant to have us. So she went, \"No,\" and the fact that she would drop me-- she dropped me off there, go and grab my stuff, go back, get changed, and then I could relax at home, and I wasn\\'t relaxed because I was agitated. The fact that Mom didn\\'t let me do it, and that there was no-- I didn\\'t see it as being practical. ### Human: Yeah. What I\\'m hearing from Mom\\'s point of view, \"It\\'s my day with you. I want to have as much time with you.\" ### Assistant: To Mom, that was a good idea, but that was her idea, so she stuck with it, and that\\'s, again, going back to the fact that that\\'s how Mom\\'s brain works. And I saw that as not very practical. Saves Mom less time, and saves me less mucking around because obviously, if let\\'s say, I had forgotten something, I\\'d have to then go back and get it. So if I would have been there, I could spend time to go, \"All right. This is what I need. This is what I need.\" But Mom said no. In and out. Two minutes th ### Human: So I\\'m hearing what you\\'d like is for Mom to be a little bit calmer around-- sometimes things don\\'t go to plan, and it\\'s not-- ### Assistant: Yeah. And to give a bit more freedom, and the fact that I can go there, and she\\'ll go, \"All right. thanks, but I\\'ll drive you back home.\" Like, \"How sweet.\" ### Human: But I\\'m hearing at the moment, that\\'s too hard for Mom to do because it\\'s that day she\\'s meant to see you. ### Assistant: And again, she-- I guess, yeah, it\\'s her day to see us, yeah, but I would prefer her to go-- instead of the fact that that\\'s her day, to go over a fortnight, we can see Mom as much as we want, and Dad as much as we want. We might spend a week at Mom\\'s and a week at Dad\\'s, and we might spend two days with Mom and the rest with Dad, or we might spend two days with Dad and the rest with Mom. I want her to see the fact that that\\'s not her allocated time. I don\\'t want that to be her allocated tim ### Human: So I\\'m hearing you want to have more of a choice in it. ### Assistant: Yeah. And that\\'s what the-- again, going back to our birthday. That\\'s when we get to because we\\'re officially 16 years old, and we can then really-- and go, \"Yeah. That\\'s what I want to do.\" ### Human: And maybe the take home message from today is having to think about now and for the next six months, are there any small things that you can do to be more independent? ### Assistant: Or is there any other things that would help me get closer to being independent. That\\'s what I\\'ve got to figure out. If I can find little things that may draw her closer to-- ### Human: And is-- ### Assistant: --sort of geting rid of the fact that taking our opinions on board, or what we want on board, and actually talking through it instead of her going, \"Yeah. I\\'ll take it on board,\" but just going , and just chucking it straight away. ### Human: So Mom actually listening. Yeah. ### Assistant: So she\\'s listening, but she\\'s not hearing. So it\\'s going in, she\\'s listened to it-- ### Human: ##h. Yeah. ### Assistant: She\\'s listened, but she hasn\\'t heard what we\\'re trying to say. I guess that\\'s a better way of explaining that\\'s how her brain works. I think that\\'s, I guess, a better way of saying it. It\\'s the fact that she\\'s heard. So she\\'s listened, but she hasn\\'t heard. At the moment, the independence is one of my biggest things. At the moment is the fact that-- so we can see Dad when there\\'s no allocated times to see Mom and Dad because-- ### Human: But it sounds like-- ### Assistant: I guess if we want to get away from Mom, if we\\'ve had a fight, we can go, \"Oh,\" and we can walk down to Dad\\'s, and we won\\'t get in trouble for it because we don\\'t have allocated times. But if we\\'re angry at Mom or angry at Dad, we can\\'t go anywhere because that\\'s allocated times. But I know if we were angry at Dad and we wanted to go back to Mom\\'s, he\\'d obviously, \"Yeah,\" but he\\'d want us to think about it and see if we wanted to stay there, or he goes, \"All right.
