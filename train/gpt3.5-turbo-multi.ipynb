      "question: Can you tell me a bit about your family background? Do you have any other family members at home?\n",
      "Yeah, sure. I grew up with my parents and my younger sister. We're a pretty close-knit family, but we do have our moments like any other family, you know? My parents are still around, but my sister moved out a while ago.\n",
      "question: What do you typically enjoy doing in your daily life? Do you have any particular interests or hobbies?\n",
      "I usually enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and going out with friends. I'm really into cooking and trying out new recipes in my free time. Oh, and I love going on hikes whenever I can!\n",
      "question: I'd like to learn about your school life. Which school do you attend, and how do you feel about it?\n",
      "I go to Lincoln High School, it's okay I guess. It's a pretty big school with lots of people, but I have some good friends there so that helps.\n",
      "question: Do you have any specific career or vocational goals? What kind of work would you like to do in the future?\n",
      "I've always enjoyed working with my hands, so I think something in carpentry or woodworking would be cool. I like the idea of creating things and seeing a finished product at the end of the day.\n",
      "question: Could you tell me about your friends or social circle? Do you have any close friends?\n",
      "Yeah, I have a few close friends that I hang out with. We like going to sports games, grabbing dinner, and just chilling together. They've been really supportive, especially during tough times.\n",
      "question: Have you experienced any past mental health issues or therapy? Do you feel these experiences have any impact on your current state?\n",
      "Yeah, I've dealt with some anxiety in the past, but therapy really helped me work through it. I think those experiences have definitely shaped how I approach my current state of mind.\n",
      "question: How would you describe your emotional and mood states in your daily life? Do you sometimes feel low or anxious?\n",
      "Yeah, I'd say my mood is usually pretty stable, but I definitely have days where I feel a bit down or stressed out. It's like a rollercoaster ride sometimes, you know?\n",
      "question: Let's talk about your family relationships. How would you describe your relationships with your family members? Do you feel family dynamics affect your mood?\n",
      "My family relationships are okay, I guess. We get along for the most part, but there are definitely some tension and disagreements at times. Yeah, family dynamics can totally affect my mood. When things are tense at home, it can really bring me down.\n",
      "question: Lastly, Tom, what do you hope to gain from therapy? How do you think therapy can help you?\n",
      "I hope therapy can help me with managing my anxiety and finding better ways to cope with stress. I think talking things out with someone who's trained to help can give me a new perspective and tools to deal with my thoughts and emotions.\n",
      "question: How would you describe your overall emotional well-being lately?\n",
      "Honestly, I've been feeling pretty down. Just kinda stuck in a rut, you know? Hoping to work through some of my issues and start feeling better.\n",
      "question: What are some things that bring you joy or fulfillment in your life?\n",
      "I love playing guitar, going for hikes with my dog, and cooking a nice meal for friends. Just simple things that make me happy, you know?\n",
      "question: Can you identify any recent stressors or challenges that you've been facing?\n",
      "Yeah, work has been super hectic lately with deadlines piling up. Plus, my relationship has been a bit rocky, which adds to the stress.\n",
      "question: How do you typically cope with difficult emotions or situations?\n",
      "I usually try to talk it out with a friend or family member. Sometimes I find going for a run helps clear my head too. And, oh yeah, playing some video games can be a great distraction.\n",
      "question: Are there any goals or aspirations that you're currently working towards?\n",
      "Yeah, I'm trying to improve my work-life balance and stress management skills. I want to prioritize self-care and find ways to unwind after a long day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you feel like there are any specific challenges or obstacles that are hindering your progress towards these goals?\n",
      "question: What do you value most in your relationships with others?\n",
      "I guess I value honesty and support the most. It's important to me that I can trust the people around me and feel like they have my back when things get tough.\n",
      "question: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior recently?\n",
      "Yeah, I've been feeling more down than usual and I've been losing interest in things I used to enjoy. My friends have also mentioned that I seem more irritable lately.\n",
      "question: How do you prioritize self-care and relaxation in your daily routine?\n",
      "I try to make time for things I enjoy, like playing guitar or going for a run. It helps me unwind and clear my mind from the day's stress. I also make sure to get enough sleep and eat well to take care of my body.\n",
      "question: Are there any past experiences or memories that continue to affect you today?\n",
      "Yeah, there are a few memories that still linger in my mind and affect how I feel about certain things now. It's like they just pop up out of nowhere sometimes and make me feel anxious or down.\n",
      "question: What does a typical day look like for you, and are there any areas where you feel you could use more support?\n",
      "Hey there, my typical day usually involves work, some exercise, and spending time with friends. I think I could use more support in managing stress and finding ways to improve my work-life balance.\n",
      "question: Tom, can you tell me more about your experiences with sleep disorders and hallucinations?\n",
      "Yeah, sure. I've been struggling with insomnia for a while now, which has led to some pretty vivid hallucinations when I do manage to fall asleep. It's been pretty unsettling and hard to deal with.\n",
      "question: How do you feel about your father's new relationship and its impact on your family dynamics?\n",
      "Honestly, I'm still trying to process it all. It's weird seeing my dad with someone new after so many years, but I guess I just want him to be happy. As for family dynamics, it's been a bit awkward, but we're figuring it out as we go along.\n",
      "question: How do you typically cope with the tension you feel regarding your parents' relationship?\n",
      "I usually try to distract myself with work or hobbies. Sometimes I talk to friends or just go for a walk to clear my head. It's tough, but I'm trying to find healthy ways to manage the stress.\n",
      "question: Could you share with me your thoughts and feelings about balancing your passion for football with your academic responsibilities?\n",
      "It's tough, you know? I love football, but sometimes it feels like it's all I think about. Balancing that with my schoolwork gets overwhelming at times. I wish I could just focus on football all day, but I know school is important too.\n",
      "question: Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that exacerbate your sleep disorders or hallucinations?\n",
      "I think stress from work deadlines and relationship issues tend to mess with my sleep and make the hallucinations worse. Sometimes even watching horror movies before bed doesn't help either!\n",
      "question: What kind of support or resources do you feel would be helpful for you in managing your challenges?\n",
      "I think having someone to talk to regularly would be helpful, like a therapist or a support group. Also, maybe some practical tips on how to cope with stress or anxiety would be good.\n",
      "question: How do you typically unwind and relax when you're feeling overwhelmed?\n",
      "I usually go for a run to clear my head, or I listen to some calming music. Sometimes I just chill on the couch with a good book or watch a movie to unwind.\n",
      "question: Are there any specific concerns or worries that keep you up at night?\n",
      "Yeah, I guess one thing that really bothers me is feeling like I'm not good enough, especially at work. I always worry about messing up and letting people down.\n",
      "question: How do you think your academic performance is being affected by your exhaustion from balancing football and studies?\n",
      "I feel like I'm falling behind in my classes because I'm always tired from football practices and games. It's hard to focus and keep up with everything. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "question: What are your goals or aspirations for yourself, both academically and personally, in the near future?\n",
      "I guess academically, I just wanna pass this semester without losing my marbles. Personally, I'm trying to find a better work-life balance and maybe start hitting the gym more regularly.\n"
